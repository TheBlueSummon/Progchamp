Anyone can share their apps with other users on {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} but only organizations that are verified by {% data variables.product.company_short %} can sell apps. For more information about organizations, see \"[About organizations](/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/about-organizations).\"  The verification process aims to protect users. For example, it verifies the seller's identity, checks that their {% data variables.product.product_name %} organization is set up securely, and that they can be contacted for support.   After passing the verification checks, any apps that the organization lists on {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} are shown with a verified creator badge {% octicon \"verified\" aria-label=\"Verified creator badge\" %}.

For more information, see \"[Security best practices for apps](/developers/github-marketplace/security-best-practices-for-apps).\"  ### Considerations for free apps  Apps will go through a security review before being listed on {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}. A successful review will meet the requirements and follow the security best practices listed in \"[Security review process](/marketplace/getting-started/security-review-process/).\" For information on the review process, contact [marketplace@github.com](mailto:marketplace@github.com). {% data reusables.marketplace.free-apps-encouraged %}   ### Requirements for paid apps  In addition to the requirements for all apps above, each app that you offer as a paid service on {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} must also meet the following requirements:  - {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %}s should have a minimum of 100 installations. - {% data variables.product.prodname_oauth_app %}s should have a minimum of 200 users. - All paid apps must handle {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} purchase events for new purchases, upgrades, downgrades, cancellations, and free trials.

For information about how integrate these events into your app, see \"[Using the {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} API in your app](/developers/github-marketplace/using-the-github-marketplace-api-in-your-app).\"  To offer your app as a paid service, you'll need to meet these requirements to list your app on {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}: Using GitHub's billing API allows customers to purchase an app without leaving GitHub and to pay for the service with the payment method already attached to their {% data variables.product.product_name %} account.  - To sell your app in {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}, it must use GitHub's billing system.

See \"[Differences between GitHub Apps and OAuth Apps](/apps/differences-between-apps/)\" for more details. - Apps should use the principle of least privilege and should only request the OAuth scopes and GitHub App permissions that the app needs to perform its intended functionality. For more information, see [Principle of least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege) in Wikipedia. - Apps should provide customers with a way to delete their account, without having to email or call a support person. - Apps should not share tokens between different implementations of the app. For example, a desktop app should have a separate token from a web-based app. Individual tokens allow each app to request the access needed for GitHub resources separately. - Design your app with different user roles, depending on the functionality needed by each type of user. For example, a standard user should not have access to admin functionality, and billing managers might not need push access to repository code. - Apps should not share service accounts such as email or database services to manage your SaaS service. - All services used in your app should have unique login and password credentials. - Admin privilege access to the production hosting infrastructure should only be given to engineers and employees with administrative duties. - Apps should not use personal access tokens to authenticate and should authenticate as an [OAuth App](/apps/about-apps/#about-oauth-apps) or a [GitHub App](/apps/about-apps/#about-github-apps):   - OAuth Apps should authenticate using an [OAuth token](/apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps/).   - GitHub Apps should authenticate using either a [JSON Web Token (JWT)](/apps/building-github-apps/authenticating-with-github-apps/#authenticating-as-a-github-app), [OAuth token](/apps/building-github-apps/identifying-and-authorizing-users-for-github-apps/), or [installation access token](/apps/building-github-apps/authenticating-with-github-apps/#authenticating-as-an-installation).  ### Data protection  - Apps should encrypt data transferred over the public internet using HTTPS, with a valid TLS certificate, or SSH for Git. - Apps should store client ID and client secret keys securely. We recommend storing them as [environmental variables](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable#Getting_and_setting_environment_variables). - Apps should delete all GitHub user data within 30 days of receiving a request from the user, or within 30 days of the end of the user's legal relationship with GitHub. - Apps should not require the user to provide their GitHub password. - Apps should encrypt tokens, client IDs, and client secrets.  ### Logging and monitoring  Apps should have logging and monitoring capabilities. App logs should be retained for at least 30 days and archived for at least one year. A security log should include:  - Authentication and authorization events - Service configuration changes - Object reads and writes - All user and group permission changes - Elevation of role to admin - Consistent timestamping for each event - Source users, IP addresses, and/or hostnames for all logged actions  ### Incident response workflow  To provide a secure experience for users, you should have a clear incident response plan in place before listing your app. We recommend having a security and operations incident response team in your company rather than using a third-party vendor. You should have the capability to notify {% data variables.product.product_name %} within 24 hours of a confirmed incident.  For an example of an incident response workflow, see the \"Data Breach Response Policy\" on the [SANS Institute website](https://www.sans.org/information-security-policy/). A short document with clear steps to take in the event of an incident is more valuable than a lengthy policy template.  ### Vulnerability management and patching workflow  You should conduct regular vulnerability scans of production infrastructure. You should triage the results of vulnerability scans and define a period of time in which you agree to remediate the vulnerability.  If you are not ready to set up a full vulnerability management program, it's useful to start by creating a patching process.

Discussions are for conversations that need to be transparent and accessible but do not need to be tracked on a project board and are not related to code, unlike issues. Discussions enable fluid, open conversation in a public forum.  Discussions give a space for more collaborative conversations by connecting and giving a more centralized area to connect and find information.  ### Enabling {% data variables.product.prodname_discussions %} on your repository  Repository owners and people with write access can enable {% data variables.product.prodname_discussions %} for a community on their public repositories.  When you first enable a {% data variables.product.prodname_discussions %}, you will be invited to configure a welcome post.  {% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %} 1.

Click **Start discussion**.   ![\"Start discussion\" button](/assets/images/help/discussions/new-discussion-start-discussion-button.png)  ### Welcoming contributions to your discussions  You can welcome your community and introduce a new way to communicate in a repository by creating a welcome post and pin the post to your {% data variables.product.prodname_discussions %} page. Pinning and locking discussions helps people know that a post is meant as an announcement. You can use announcements as a way to link people to more resources and offer guidance for opening discussions in your community. For more information about pinning a discussion, see \"[Managing discussions in your repository](/discussions/managing-discussions-for-your-community/managing-discussions-in-your-repository#pinning-a-discussion).\"   ### Setting up community guidelines for contributors  You can set contributing guidelines to encourage collaborators to have meaningful, useful conversations that are relevant to the repository. You can also update the repository's README to communicate expectations on when collaborators should open an issue or discussion.  For more information about providing guidelines for your project, see \"[Adding a code of conduct to your project](/github/building-a-strong-community/adding-a-code-of-conduct-to-your-project)\" and \"[Setting up your project for healthy contributions](/github/building-a-strong-community/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions).\"  ### Creating a new discussion  Anyone with access to a repository can create a discussion.  {% data reusables.discussions.starting-a-discussion %}  ### Organizing discussions into relevant categories  Repository owners and people with write access can create new categories to keep discussions organized. Collaborators participating and creating new discussions can group discussions into the most relevant existing categories. Discussions can also be recategorized after they are created. For more information, see \"[Managing categories for discussions in your repository](/discussions/managing-discussions-for-your-community/managing-categories-for-discussions-in-your-repository)\"  ### Promoting healthy conversations  People with write permissions for a repository can help surface important conversations by pinning discussions, deleting discussions that are no longer useful or are damaging to the community, and transferring discussions to more relevant repositories owned by the organization. For more information, see \"[Managing discussions in your repository](/discussions/managing-discussions-for-your-community/managing-discussions-in-your-repository).\"  People with triage permissions for a repository can help moderate a project's discussions by marking comments as answers, locking discussions that are not longer useful or are damaging to the community, and converting issues to discussions when an idea is still in the early stages of development. For more information, see \"[Moderating discussions](/discussions/managing-discussions-for-your-community/moderating-discussions).\"  ### Next steps  Once there is a clear path to scope work out and move an idea from concept to reality, you can create an issue and start tracking your progress.

Each organization can have multiple classrooms.  After you create a classroom, {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %} will prompt you to invite teaching assistants (TAs) and admins to the classroom. Each classroom can have one or more admins. Admins can be teachers, TAs, or any other course administrator who you'd like to have control over your classrooms on {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %}.  Invite TAs and admins to your classroom by inviting the user accounts on {% data variables.product.product_name %} to your organization as organization owners and sharing the URL for your classrom. Organization owners can administer any classroom for the organization. For more information, see \"[Permission levels for an organization](/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/permission-levels-for-an-organization)\" and \"[Inviting users to join your organization](/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/inviting-users-to-join-your-organization).\"  When you're done using a classroom, you can archive the classroom and refer to the classroom, roster, and assignments later, or you can delete the classroom if you no longer need the classroom.  ### About classroom rosters  Each classroom has a roster. A roster is a list of identifiers for the students who participate in your course.  When you first share the URL for an assignment with a student, the student must sign into {% data variables.product.product_name %} with a user account to link the user account to an identifier for the classroom. After the student links a user account, you can see the associated user account in the roster. You can also see when the student accepts or submits an assignment.  ![Classroom roster](/assets/images/help/classroom/roster-hero.png)  ### Prerequisites  You must have an organization account on {% data variables.product.product_name %} to manage classrooms on {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %}.

        "description": "What is Python? Executive Summary Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.   Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides. Since there is no compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast. Debugging Python programs is easy: a bug or bad input will never cause a segmentation fault. Instead, when the interpreter discovers an error, it raises an exception. When the program doesn't catch the exception, the interpreter prints a stack trace. A source level debugger allows inspection of local and global variables, evaluation of arbitrary expressions, setting breakpoints, stepping through the code a line at a time, and so on. The debugger is written in Python itself, testifying to Python's introspective power. On the other hand, often the quickest way to debug a program is to add a few print statements to the source: the fast edit-test-debug cycle makes this simple approach very effective.  What is Python? Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.  It is used for:  web development (server-side), software development, mathematics, system scripting.  What can Python do?  Python can be used on a server to create web applications. Python can be used alongside software to create workflows. Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files. Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics. Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.  Why Python?  Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc). Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language. Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages. Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick. Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.  Good to know  The most recent major version of Python is Python 3, which we shall be using in this tutorial. However, Python 2, although not being updated with anything other than security updates, is still quite popular. In this tutorial Python will be written in a text editor. It is possible to write Python in an Integrated Development Environment, such as Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse which are particularly useful when managing larger collections of Python files.  Python Syntax compared to other programming languages  Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics. Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses. Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.  Applications for Python  Python is used in many application domains. Here's a sampling.  The Python Package Index lists thousands of third party modules for Python.  Web and Internet Development  Python offers many choices for web development:  Frameworks such as Django and Pyramid. Micro-frameworks such as Flask and Bottle. Advanced content management systems such as Plone and django CMS.  Python's standard library supports many Internet protocols:  HTML and XML JSON E-mail processing. Support for FTP, IMAP, and other Internet protocols. Easy-to-use socket interface.  And the Package Index has yet more libraries:  Requests, a powerful HTTP client library. Beautiful Soup, an HTML parser that can handle all sorts of oddball HTML. Feedparser for parsing RSS/Atom feeds. Paramiko, implementing the SSH2 protocol. Twisted Python, a framework for asynchronous network programming.  Scientific and Numeric  Python is widely used in scientific and numeric computing:  SciPy is a collection of packages for mathematics, science, and engineering.  Pandas is a data analysis and modeling library. IPython is a powerful interactive shell that features easy editing and recording of a work session, and supports visualizations and parallel computing.  The Software Carpentry Course teaches basic skills for scientific computing, running bootcamps and providing open-access teaching materials. Education Python is a superb language for teaching programming, both at the introductory level and in more advanced courses.  Books such as How to Think Like a Computer Scientist, Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science, and Practical Programming. The Education Special Interest Group is a good place to discuss teaching issues. Desktop GUIs The Tk GUI library is included with most binary distributions of Python.  Some toolkits that are usable on several platforms are available separately:  wxWidgets Kivy, for writing multitouch applications. Qt via pyqt or pyside Platform-specific toolkits are also available:  GTK+ Microsoft Foundation Classes through the win32 extensions Software Development Python is often used as a support language for software developers, for build control and management, testing, and in many other ways.  SCons for build control.  Buildbot and Apache Gump for automated continuous compilation and testing. Roundup or Trac for bug tracking and project management. Business Applications Python is also used to build ERP and e-commerce systems:  Odoo is an all-in-one management software that offers a range of business applications that form a complete suite of enterprise management applications. Try ton is a three-tier high-level general purpose application platform.",

        "description": "What is C#? C# is pronounced \"C-Sharp\".  It is an object-oriented programming language created by Microsoft that runs on the .NET Framework.  C# has roots from the C family, and the language is close to other popular languages like C++ and Java.  The first version was released in year 2002. The latest version, C# 8, was released in September 2019.  C# is a modern object-oriented programming language developed in 2000 by Anders Hejlsberg, the principal designer and lead architect at Microsoft. It is pronounced as \"C-Sharp,\" inspired by the musical notation \u201c\u266f\u201d which stands for a note with a slightly higher pitch. As it\u2019s considered an incremental compilation of the C++ language, the name C \u201csharp\u201d seemed most appropriate. The sharp symbol, however, has been replaced by the keyboard friendly \u201c#\u201d as a suffix to \u201cC\u201d for purposes of programming.  Although the code is very similar to C++, C# is newer and has grown fast with extensive support from Microsoft. The fact that it\u2019s so similar to Java syntactically helps explain why it has emerged as one of the most popular programming languages today.   C# is pronounced \"C-Sharp\".  It is an object-oriented programming language created by Microsoft that runs on the .NET Framework.  C# has roots from the C family, and the language is close to other popular languages like C++ and Java.  The first version was released in year 2002. The latest version, C# 8, was released in September 2019.  C# is used for:  Mobile applications Desktop applications Web applications Web services Web sites Games VR Database applications And much, much more!  An Introduction to C# Programming  C# is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language that is structured and easy to learn. It runs on Microsoft\u2019s .Net Framework and can be compiled on a variety of computer platforms. As the syntax is simple and easy to learn, developers familiar with C, C++, or Java have found a comfort zone within C#.  C# is a boon for developers who want to build a wide range of applications on the .NET Framework\u2014Windows applications, Web applications, and Web services\u2014in addition to building mobile apps, Windows Store apps, and enterprise software. It is thus considered a powerful programming language and features in every developer\u2019s cache of tools.  Although first released in 2002, when it was introduced with .NET Framework 1.0, the C# language has evolved a great deal since then. The most recent version is C# 8.0, available in preview as part of Visual Studio. To get access to all of the new language features, you would need to install the latest preview version of .NET Core 3.0.   C# is used for:  Mobile applications Desktop applications Web applications Web services Web sites Games VR Database applications And much, much more!  Why Use C#?  It is one of the most popular programming language in the world It is easy to learn and simple to use It has a huge community support C# is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs. As C# is close to C, C++ and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C# or vice versa.   The C# Environment  You need the .NET Framework and an IDE (integrated development environment) to work with the C# language.  The .NET Framework  The .NET Framework platform of the Windows OS is required to write web and desktop-based applications using not only C# but also Visual Basic and Jscript, as the platform provides language interoperability. Besides, the .Net Framework allows C# to communicate with any of the other common languages, such as C++, Jscript, COBOL, and so on.   IDEs  Microsoft provides various IDEs for C# programming:  Visual Studio 2010 (VS) Visual Studio Express Visual Web Developer Visual Studio Code (VSC)  The C# source code files can be written using a basic text editor, like Notepad, and compiled using the command-line compiler of the .NET Framework.   Alternative open-source versions of the .Net Framework can work on other operating systems as well. For instance, the Mono has a C# compiler and runs on several operating systems, including Linux, Mac, Android, BSD, iOS, Windows, Solaris, and UNIX. This brings enhanced development tools to the developer.   As C# is part of the .Net Framework platform, it has access to its enormous library of codes and components, such as Common Language Runtime (CLR), the .Net Framework Class Library, Common Language Specification, Common Type System, Metadata and Assemblies, Windows Forms, ASP.Net and ASP.Net AJAX, Windows Workflow Foundation (WF), Windows Communication Foundation (WCF), and LINQ.   C# and Java  C# and Java are high-level programming languages that share several similarities (as well as many differences). They are both object-oriented languages much influenced by C++. But while C# is suitable for application development in the Microsoft ecosystem from the front, Java is considered best for client-side web applications. Also, while C# has many tools for programming, Java has a larger arsenal of tools to choose from in IDEs and Text Editors.   C# is used for virtual reality projects like games, mobile, and web applications. It is built specifically for Microsoft platforms and several non-Microsoft-based operating systems, like the Mono Project that works with Linux and OS X.  Java is used for creating messaging applications and developing web-based and enterprise-based applications in open-source ecosystems.  Both C# and Java support arrays. However, each language uses them differently. In C#, arrays are a specialization of the system; in Java, they are a direct specialization of the object.   The C# programming language executes on the CLR. The source code is interpreted into bytecode, which is further compiled by the CLR. Java runs on any platform with the assistance of JRE (Java Runtime Environment). The written source code is first compiled into bytecode and then converted into machine code to be executed on a JRE.   C# and C++   Although C# and C++ are both C-based languages with similar code, there are some differences. For one, C# is considered a component-oriented programming language, while C++ is a partial object-oriented language. Also, while both languages are compiled languages, C# compiles to CLR and is interpreted by.NET, but C++ compiles to machine code. The size of binaries in C# is much larger than in C++.  Other differences between the two include the following:  C# gives compiler errors and warnings, but C++ doesn\u2019t support warnings, which may cause damage to the OS. C# runs in a virtual machine for automatic memory management. C++ requires you to manage memory manually. C# can create Windows, .NET, web, desktop, and mobile applications, but not stand-alone apps. C++ can create server-side, stand-alone, and console applications as it can work directly with the hardware. C++ can be used on any platform, while C# is targeted toward Windows OS. Generally, C++ being faster than C#, the former is preferred for applications where performance is essential.    Features of C#  The C# programming language has many features that make it more useful and unique when compared to other languages, including:   Object-oriented language Being object-oriented, C# allows the creation of modular applications and reusable codes, an advantage over C++. As an object-oriented language, C# makes development and maintenance easier when project size grows. It supports all three object-oriented features: data encapsulation, inheritance, interfaces, and polymorphism.  Simplicity C# is a simple language with a structured approach to problem-solving. Unsafe operations, like direct memory manipulation, are not allowed.  Speed The compilation and execution time in C# is very powerful and fast.   A Modern programming language C# programming is used for building scalable and interoperable applications with support for modern features like automatic garbage collection, error handling, debugging, and robust security. It has built-in support for a web service to be invoked from any app running on any platform.  Type-safe Arrays and objects are zero base indexed and bound checked. There is an automatic checking of the overflow of types. The C# type safety instances support robust programming.  Interoperability Language interoperability of C# maximizes code reuse for the efficiency of the development process. C# programs can work upon almost anything as a program can call out any native API.  Consistency Its unified type system enables developers to extend the type system simply and easily for consistent behavior.  Updateable C# is automatically updateable. Its versioning support enables complex frameworks to be developed and evolved.  Component oriented C# supports component-oriented programming through the concepts of properties, methods, events, and attributes for self-contained and self-describing components of functionality for robust and scalable applications.  Structured Programming Language The structured design and modularization in C# break a problem into parts, using functions for easy implementation to solve significant problems.  Rich Library C# has a standard library with many inbuilt functions for easy and fast development.   Prerequisites for Learning C#   Basic knowledge of C or C++ or any programming language or programming fundamentals.   Additionally, the OOP concept makes for a short learning curve of C#.   Advantages of C#   There are many advantages to the C# language that makes it a useful programming language compared to other languages like Java, C, or C++. These include:  Being an object-oriented language, C# allows you to create modular, maintainable applications and reusable codes  Familiar syntax  Easy to develop as it has a rich class of libraries for smooth implementation of functions   Enhanced integration as an application written in .NET will integrate and interpret better when compared to other NET technologies   As C# runs on CLR, it makes it easy to integrate with components written in other languages  It\u2019s safe, with no data loss as there is no type-conversion so that you can write secure codes  The automatic garbage collection keeps the system clean and doesn\u2019t hang it during execution  As your machine has to install the .NET Framework to run C#, it supports cross-platform  Strong memory backup prevents memory leakage   Programming support of the Microsoft ecosystem makes development easy and seamless  Low maintenance cost, as C# can develop iOS, Android, and Windows Phone native apps  The syntax is similar to C, C++, and Java, which makes it easier to learn and work with C#  Useful as it can develop iOS, Android, and Windows Phone native apps with the Xamarin Framework  C# is the most powerful programming language for the .NET Framework  Fast development as C# is open source steered by Microsoft with access to open source projects and tools on Github, and many active communities contributing to the improvement  What Can C Sharp Do for You?  C# can be used to develop a wide range of:  Windows client applications Windows libraries and components Windows services Web applications Native iOS and Android mobile apps Azure cloud applications and services Gaming consoles and gaming systems Video and virtual reality games Interoperability software like SharePoint Enterprise software Backend services and database programs AI and ML applications Distributed applications Hardware-level programming Virus and malware software GUI-based applications IoT devices Blockchain and distributed ledger technology   C# Programming for Beginners: Introduction, Features and Applications By Simplilearn Last updated on Jan 20, 2020674 C# Programming for Beginners As a programmer, you\u2019re motivated to master the most popular languages that will give you an edge in your career.

It strives to directly map the requests and responses of those specifications, while following the idiomatic style of the implementation language. In addition to mapping the raw protocol flows, convenience methods are available to assist with common tasks like performing an action with fresh tokens.  The library follows the best practices set out in [RFC 8252 - OAuth 2.0 for Native Apps](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8252), including using [Custom Tabs](https://developer.chrome.com/multidevice/android/customtabs) for authorization requests. For this reason, `WebView` is explicitly *not* supported due to usability and security reasons.  The library also supports the [PKCE](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636) extension to OAuth which was created to secure authorization codes in public clients when custom URI scheme redirects are used. The library is friendly to other extensions (standard or otherwise) with the ability to handle additional parameters in all protocol requests and responses.  A talk providing an overview of using the library for enterprise single sign-on (produced by Google) can be found here: [Enterprise SSO with Chrome Custom Tabs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdQTXrk6YTk).  ## Download  AppAuth for Android is available on [MavenCentral](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:net.openid%20appauth)  ```groovy implementation 'net.openid:appauth:<version>' ```  ## Requirements  AppAuth supports Android API 16 (Jellybean) and above. Browsers which provide a custom tabs implementation are preferred by the library, but not required. Both Custom URI Schemes (all supported versions of Android) and App Links (Android M / API 23+) can be used with the library.  In general, AppAuth can work with any Authorization Server (AS) that supports native apps as documented in [RFC 8252](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8252), either through custom URI scheme redirects, or App Links. AS's that assume all clients are web-based or require clients to maintain confidentiality of the client secrets may not work well.  ## Demo app  A demo app is contained within this repository. For instructions on how to build and configure this app, see the [demo app readme](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-Android/blob/master/app/README.md).  ## Conceptual overview  AppAuth encapsulates the authorization state of the user in the [net.openid.appauth.AuthState](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-Android/blob/master/library/java/net/openid/appauth/AuthState.java) class, and communicates with an authorization server through the use of the [net.openid.appauth.AuthorizationService](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-Android/blob/master/library/java/net/openid/appauth/AuthorizationService.java) class. AuthState is designed to be easily persistable as a JSON string, using the storage mechanism of your choice (e.g. [SharedPreferences](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/data-storage/shared-preferences.html), [sqlite](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/data-storage/databases.html), or even just [in a file](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/data-storage/files.html)).  AppAuth provides data classes which are intended to model the OAuth2 specification as closely as possible; this provides the greatest flexibility in interacting with a wide variety of OAuth2 and OpenID Connect implementations.  Authorizing the user occurs via the user's web browser, and the request is described using instances of [AuthorizationRequest](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-Android/blob/master/library/java/net/openid/appauth/AuthorizationRequest.java). The request is dispatched using [performAuthorizationRequest()](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-Android/blob/master/library/java/net/openid/appauth/AuthorizationService.java#L159) on an AuthorizationService instance, and the response (an [AuthorizationResponse](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-Android/blob/master/library/java/net/openid/appauth/AuthorizationResponse.java) instance) will be dispatched to the activity of your choice, expressed via an Intent.  Token requests, such as obtaining a new access token using a refresh token, follow a similar pattern: [TokenRequest](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-Android/blob/master/library/java/net/openid/appauth/TokenRequest.java) instances are dispatched using [performTokenRequest()](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-Android/blob/master/library/java/net/openid/appauth/AuthorizationService.java#L252) on an AuthorizationService instance, and a [TokenResponse](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-Android/blob/master/library/java/net/openid/appauth/TokenResponse.java) instance is returned via a callback.  Responses can be provided to the [update()](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-Android/blob/master/library/java/net/openid/appauth/AuthState.java#L367) methods on AuthState in order to track and persist changes to the authorization state. Once in an authorized state, the [performActionWithFreshTokens()](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-Android/blob/master/library/java/net/openid/appauth/AuthState.java#L449) method on AuthState can be used to automatically refresh access tokens as necessary before performing actions that require valid tokens.  ## Implementing the authorization code flow  It is recommended that native apps use the [authorization code](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.3.1) flow with a public client to gain authorization to access user data. This has the primary advantage for native clients that the authorization flow, which must occur in a browser, only needs to be performed once.  This flow is effectively composed of four stages:  1. Discovering or specifying the endpoints to interact with the provider. 2. Authorizing the user, via a browser, in order to obtain an authorization    code. 3. Exchanging the authorization code with the authorization server, to obtain    a refresh token and/or ID token. 4. Using access tokens derived from the refresh token to interact with a    resource server for further access to user data.  At each step of the process, an AuthState instance can (optionally) be updated with the result to help with tracking the state of the flow.  ### Authorization service configuration  First, AppAuth must be instructed how to interact with the authorization service. This can be done either by directly creating an [AuthorizationServiceConfiguration](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-Android/blob/master/library/java/net/openid/appauth/AuthorizationServiceConfiguration.java#L102) instance, or by retrieving an OpenID Connect discovery document.  Directly specifying an AuthorizationServiceConfiguration involves providing the URIs of the authorization endpoint and token endpoint, and optionally a dynamic client registration endpoint (see \"Dynamic client registration\" for more info):  ```java AuthorizationServiceConfiguration serviceConfig =     new AuthorizationServiceConfiguration(         Uri.parse(\"https://idp.example.com/auth\"), // authorization endpoint         Uri.parse(\"https://idp.example.com/token\")); // token endpoint ```  Where available, using an OpenID Connect discovery document is preferable:  ```java AuthorizationServiceConfiguration.fetchFromIssuer(     Uri.parse(\"https://idp.example.com\"),     new AuthorizationServiceConfiguration.RetrieveConfigurationCallback() {       public void onFetchConfigurationCompleted(           @Nullable AuthorizationServiceConfiguration serviceConfiguration,           @Nullable AuthorizationException ex) {         if (ex != null) {           Log.e(TAG, \"failed to fetch configuration\");           return;         }          // use serviceConfiguration as needed     } }); ```  This will attempt to download a discovery document from the standard location under this base URI, `https://idp.example.com/.well-known/openid-configuration`. If the discovery document for your IDP is in some other non-standard location, you can instead provide the full URI as follows:  ```java AuthorizationServiceConfiguration.fetchFromUrl(     Uri.parse(\"https://idp.example.com/exampletenant/openid-config\"),     new AuthorizationServiceConfiguration.RetrieveConfigurationCallback() {         ...     } }); ```  If desired, this configuration can be used to seed an AuthState instance, to persist the configuration easily:  ```java AuthState authState = new AuthState(serviceConfig); ```  ### Obtaining an authorization code  An authorization code can now be acquired by constructing an AuthorizationRequest, using its Builder. In AppAuth, the builders for each data class accept the mandatory parameters via the builder constructor:  ```java AuthorizationRequest.Builder authRequestBuilder =     new AuthorizationRequest.Builder(         serviceConfig, // the authorization service configuration         MY_CLIENT_ID, // the client ID, typically pre-registered and static         ResponseTypeValues.CODE, // the response_type value: we want a code         MY_REDIRECT_URI); // the redirect URI to which the auth response is sent ```  Other optional parameters, such as the OAuth2 [scope string](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-3.3) or OpenID Connect [login hint](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#rfc.section.3.1.2.1) are specified through set methods on the builder:  ```java AuthorizationRequest authRequest = authRequestBuilder     .setScope(\"openid email profile https://idp.example.com/custom-scope\")     .setLoginHint(\"jdoe@user.example.com\")     .build(); ```  This request can then be dispatched using one of two approaches.  a `startActivityForResult` call using an Intent returned from the `AuthorizationService`, or by calling `performAuthorizationRequest` and providing pending intent for completion and cancelation handling activities.  The `startActivityForResult` approach is simpler to use but may require more processing of the result:  ```java private void doAuthorization() {   AuthorizationService authService = new AuthorizationService(this);   Intent authIntent = authService.getAuthorizationRequestIntent(authRequest);   startActivityForResult(authIntent, RC_AUTH); }  @Override protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {   if (requestCode == RC_AUTH) {     AuthorizationResponse resp = AuthorizationResponse.fromIntent(data);     AuthorizationException ex = AuthorizationException.fromIntent(data);     // ... process the response or exception ...   } else {     // ...   } } ```  If instead you wish to directly transition to another activity on completion or cancelation, you can use `performAuthorizationRequest`:  ```java AuthorizationService authService = new AuthorizationService(this);  authService.performAuthorizationRequest(     authRequest,     PendingIntent.getActivity(this, 0, new Intent(this, MyAuthCompleteActivity.class), 0),     PendingIntent.getActivity(this, 0, new Intent(this, MyAuthCanceledActivity.class), 0)); ```  The intents may be customized to carry any additional data or flags required for the correct handling of the authorization response.  #### Capturing the authorization redirect  Once the authorization flow is completed in the browser, the authorization service will redirect to a URI specified as part of the authorization request, providing the response via query parameters. In order for your app to capture this response, it must register with the Android OS as a handler for this redirect URI.  We recommend using a custom scheme based redirect URI (i.e. those of form `my.scheme:/path`), as this is the most widely supported across all versions of Android. To avoid conflicts with other apps, it is recommended to configure a  distinct scheme using \"reverse domain name notation\". This can either match your service web domain (in reverse) e.g. `com.example.service` or your package name `com.example.app` or be something completely new as long as it's distinct enough. Using the package name of your app is quite common but it's not always possible if it contains illegal characters for URI schemes (like underscores) or if you already have another handler for that scheme - so just use something else.  When a custom scheme is used, AppAuth can be easily configured to capture all redirects using this custom scheme through a manifest placeholder:  ```groovy android.defaultConfig.manifestPlaceholders = [   'appAuthRedirectScheme': 'com.example.app' ] ```  Alternatively, the redirect URI can be directly configured by adding an intent-filter for AppAuth's RedirectUriReceiverActivity to your AndroidManifest.xml:  ```xml <activity         android:name=\"net.openid.appauth.RedirectUriReceiverActivity\"         tools:node=\"replace\">     <intent-filter>         <action android:name=\"android.intent.action.VIEW\"/>         <category android:name=\"android.intent.category.DEFAULT\"/>         <category android:name=\"android.intent.category.BROWSABLE\"/>         <data android:scheme=\"com.example.app\"/>     </intent-filter> </activity> ```  If an HTTPS redirect URI is required instead of a custom scheme, the same approach (modifying your AndroidManifest.xml) is used:  ```xml <activity         android:name=\"net.openid.appauth.RedirectUriReceiverActivity\"         tools:node=\"replace\">     <intent-filter>         <action android:name=\"android.intent.action.VIEW\"/>         <category android:name=\"android.intent.category.DEFAULT\"/>         <category android:name=\"android.intent.category.BROWSABLE\"/>         <data android:scheme=\"https\"               android:host=\"app.example.com\"               android:path=\"/oauth2redirect\"/>     </intent-filter> </activity> ```  HTTPS redirects can be secured by configuring the redirect URI as an [app link](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/index.html) in Android M and above. We recommend that a fallback page be configured at the same address to forward authorization responses to your app via a custom scheme, for older Android devices.  #### Handling the authorization response  Upon completion of the authorization flow, the completion Intent provided to performAuthorizationRequest will be triggered. The authorization response is provided to this activity via Intent extra data, which can be extracted using the `fromIntent()` methods on AuthorizationResponse and AuthorizationException respectively:  ```java public void onCreate(Bundle b) {   AuthorizationResponse resp = AuthorizationResponse.fromIntent(getIntent());   AuthorizationException ex = AuthorizationException.fromIntent(getIntent());   if (resp != null) {     // authorization completed   } else {     // authorization failed, check ex for more details   }   // ... } ```  The response can be provided to the AuthState instance for easy persistence and further processing:  ``` authState.update(resp, ex); ```  If the full redirect URI is required in order to extract additional information that AppAuth does not provide, this is also provided to your activity:  ```java public void onCreate(Bundle b) {   // ...   Uri redirectUri = getIntent().getData();   // ... } ```  ### Exchanging the authorization code  Given a successful authorization response carrying an authorization code, a token request can be made to exchange the code for a refresh token:  ```java authService.performTokenRequest(     resp.createTokenExchangeRequest(),     new AuthorizationService.TokenResponseCallback() {       @Override public void onTokenRequestCompleted(             TokenResponse resp, AuthorizationException ex) {           if (resp != null) {             // exchange succeeded           } else {             // authorization failed, check ex for more details           }         }     }); ```  The token response can also be used to update an AuthState instance:  ```java authState.update(resp, ex); ```  ### Using access tokens  Finally, the retrieved access token can be used to interact with a resource server. This can be done directly, by extracting the access token from a token response. However, in most cases, it is simpler to use the `performActionWithFreshTokens` utility method provided by AuthState:  ```java authState.performActionWithFreshTokens(service, new AuthStateAction() {   @Override public void execute(       String accessToken,       String idToken,       AuthorizationException ex) {     if (ex != null) {       // negotiation for fresh tokens failed, check ex for more details       return;     }      // use the access token to do something ...   } }); ```  This also updates the AuthState object with current access, id, and refresh tokens. If you are storing your AuthState in persistent storage, you should write the updated copy in the callback to this method.  ### Ending current session  Given you have a logged in session and you want to end it. In that case you need to get: - `AuthorizationServiceConfiguration` - valid Open Id Token that you should get after authentication - End of session URI that should be provided within you OpenId service config  First you have to build EndSessionRequest  ```java EndSessionRequest endSessionRequest =     new EndSessionRequest.Builder(authorizationServiceConfiguration)         .setIdTokenHint(idToken)         .setPostLogoutRedirectUri(endSessionRedirectUri)         .build(); ``` This request can then be dispatched using one of two approaches.  a `startActivityForResult` call using an Intent returned from the `AuthorizationService`, or by calling `performEndSessionRequest` and providing pending intent for completion and cancelation handling activities.  The startActivityForResult approach is simpler to use but may require more processing of the result:  ```java private void endSession() {   AuthorizationService authService = new AuthorizationService(this);   Intent endSessionItent = authService.getEndSessionRequestIntent(endSessionRequest);   startActivityForResult(endSessionItent, RC_END_SESSION); }  @Override protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {   if (requestCode == RC_END_SESSION) {     EndSessionResonse resp = EndSessionResonse.fromIntent(data);     AuthorizationException ex = AuthorizationException.fromIntent(data);     // ... process the response or exception ...   } else {     // ...   } } ``` If instead you wish to directly transition to another activity on completion or cancelation, you can use `performEndSessionRequest`:  ```java AuthorizationService authService = new AuthorizationService(this);  authService.performEndSessionRequest(     endSessionRequest,     PendingIntent.getActivity(this, 0, new Intent(this, MyAuthCompleteActivity.class), 0),     PendingIntent.getActivity(this, 0, new Intent(this, MyAuthCanceledActivity.class), 0)); ```  End session flow will also work involving browser mechanism that is described in authorization mechanism session. Handling response mechanism with transition to another activity should be as follows:   ```java public void onCreate(Bundle b) {   EndSessionResponse resp = EndSessionResponse.fromIntent(getIntent());   AuthorizationException ex = AuthorizationException.fromIntent(getIntent());   if (resp != null) {     // authorization completed   } else {     // authorization failed, check ex for more details   }   // ... } ```  ### AuthState persistence  Instances of `AuthState` keep track of the authorization and token requests and responses. This is the only object that you need to persist to retain the authorization state of the session. Typically, one would do this by storing the authorization state in SharedPreferences or some other persistent store private to the app:  ```java @NonNull public AuthState readAuthState() {   SharedPreferences authPrefs = getSharedPreferences(\"auth\", MODE_PRIVATE);   String stateJson = authPrefs.getString(\"stateJson\", null);   if (stateJson != null) {     return AuthState.jsonDeserialize(stateJson);   } else {     return new AuthState();   } }  public void writeAuthState(@NonNull AuthState state) {   SharedPreferences authPrefs = getSharedPreferences(\"auth\", MODE_PRIVATE);   authPrefs.edit()       .putString(\"stateJson\", state.jsonSerializeString())       .apply(); } ```  The demo app has an [AuthStateManager](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-Android/blob/master/app/java/net/openid/appauthdemo/AuthStateManager.java) type which demonstrates this in more detail.  ## Advanced configuration  AppAuth provides some advanced configuration options via [AppAuthConfiguration](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-Android/blob/master/library/java/net/openid/appauth/AppAuthConfiguration.java) instances, which can be provided to [AuthorizationService](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-Android/blob/master/library/java/net/openid/appauth/AuthorizationService.java) during construction.  ### Controlling which browser is used for authorization  Some applications require explicit control over which browsers can be used for authorization - for example, to require that Chrome be used for second factor authentication to work, or require that some custom browser is used for authentication in an enterprise environment.  Control over which browsers can be used can be achieved by defining a [BrowserMatcher](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-Android/blob/master/library/java/net/openid/appauth/browser/BrowserMatcher.java), and supplying this to the builder of AppAuthConfiguration. A BrowserMatcher is suppled with a [BrowserDescriptor](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-Android/blob/master/library/java/net/openid/appauth/browser/BrowserDescriptor.java) instance, and must decide whether this browser is permitted for the authorization flow.  By default, [AnyBrowserMatcher](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-Android/blob/master/library/java/net/openid/appauth/browser/AnyBrowserMatcher.java) is used.  For your convenience, utility classes to help define a browser matcher are provided, such as:  - [Browsers](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-Android/blob/master/library/java/net/openid/appauth/browser/Browsers.java):   contains a set of constants for the official package names and signatures   of Chrome, Firefox and Samsung SBrowser. - [VersionedBrowserMatcher](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-Android/blob/master/library/java/net/openid/appauth/browser/VersionedBrowserMatcher.java):   will match a browser if it has a matching package name and signature, and   a version number within a defined   [VersionRange](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-Android/blob/master/library/java/net/openid/appauth/browser/VersionRange.java). This class also provides some static instances for matching   Chrome, Firefox and Samsung SBrowser. - [BrowserAllowList](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-Android/blob/master/library/java/net/openid/appauth/browser/BrowserAllowList.java):   takes a list of BrowserMatcher instances, and will match a browser if any   of these child BrowserMatcher instances signals a match. - [BrowserDenyList](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-Android/blob/master/library/java/net/openid/appauth/browser/BrowserDenyList.java):   the inverse of BrowserAllowList - takes a list of browser matcher instances,   and will match a browser if it _does not_ match any of these child   BrowserMatcher instances.  For instance, in order to restrict the authorization flow to using Chrome or SBrowser as a custom tab:  ```java AppAuthConfiguration appAuthConfig = new AppAuthConfiguration.Builder()     .setBrowserMatcher(new BrowserAllowList(         VersionedBrowserMatcher.CHROME_CUSTOM_TAB,         VersionedBrowserMatcher.SAMSUNG_CUSTOM_TAB))     .build(); AuthorizationService authService =         new AuthorizationService(context, appAuthConfig); ```  Or, to prevent the use of a buggy version of the custom tabs in Samsung SBrowser:  ```java AppAuthConfiguration appAuthConfig = new AppAuthConfiguration.Builder()     .setBrowserMatcher(new BrowserDenyList(         new VersionedBrowserMatcher(             Browsers.SBrowser.PACKAGE_NAME,             Browsers.SBrowser.SIGNATURE_SET,             true, // when this browser is used via a custom tab             VersionRange.atMost(\"5.3\")         )))     .build(); AuthorizationService authService =         new AuthorizationService(context, appAuthConfig); ```  ### Customizing the connection builder for HTTP requests  It can be desirable to customize how HTTP connections are made when performing token requests, for instance to use [certificate pinning](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Certificate_and_Public_Key_Pinning) or to add additional trusted certificate authorities for an enterprise environment. This can be achieved in AppAuth by providing a custom [ConnectionBuilder](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-Android/blob/master/library/java/net/openid/appauth/connectivity/ConnectionBuilder.java) instance.  For example, to custom the SSL socket factory used, one could do the following:  ```java AppAuthConfiguration appAuthConfig = new AppAuthConfiguration.Builder()     .setConnectionBuilder(new ConnectionBuilder() {       public HttpURLConnection openConnect(Uri uri) throws IOException {         URL url = new URL(uri.toString());         HttpURLConnection connection =             (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();         if (connection instanceof HttpsUrlConnection) {           HttpsURLConnection connection = (HttpsURLConnection) connection;           connection.setSSLSocketFactory(MySocketFactory.getInstance());         }       }     })     .build(); ```  ### Issues with [ID Token](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-Android/blob/master/library/java/net/openid/appauth/IdToken.java#L118) validation  ID Token validation was introduced in `0.8.0` but not all authorization servers or configurations support it correctly.  - For testing environments [setSkipIssuerHttpsCheck](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-Android/blob/master/library/java/net/openid/appauth/AppAuthConfiguration.java#L129) can be used to bypass the fact the issuer needs to be HTTPS.  ```java AppAuthConfiguration appAuthConfig = new AppAuthConfiguration.Builder()     .setSkipIssuerHttpsCheck(true)     .build() ```  - For services that don't support nonce[s] resulting in **IdTokenException** `Nonce mismatch` just set nonce to `null` on the `AuthorizationRequest`. Please consider **raising an issue** with your Identity Provider and removing this once it is fixed.  ```java AuthorizationRequest authRequest = authRequestBuilder     .setNonce(null)     .build(); ```  ## Dynamic client registration  AppAuth supports the [OAuth2 dynamic client registration protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7591). In order to dynamically register a client, create a [RegistrationRequest](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-Android/blob/master/library/java/net/openid/appauth/RegistrationRequest.java) and dispatch it using [performRegistrationRequest](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-Android/blob/master/library/java/net/openid/appauth/AuthorizationService.java#L278) on your AuthorizationService instance.  The registration endpoint can either be defined directly as part of your [AuthorizationServiceConfiguration](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-Android/blob/master/library/java/net/openid/appauth/AuthorizationServiceConfiguration.java), or discovered from an OpenID Connect discovery document.  ```java RegistrationRequest registrationRequest = new RegistrationRequest.Builder(     serviceConfig,     Arrays.asList(redirectUri))     .build(); ```  Requests are dispatched with the help of `AuthorizationService`. As this request is asynchronous the response is passed to a callback:  ```java service.performRegistrationRequest(     registrationRequest,     new AuthorizationService.RegistrationResponseCallback() {         @Override public void onRegistrationRequestCompleted(             @Nullable RegistrationResponse resp,             @Nullable AuthorizationException ex) {             if (resp != null) {                 // registration succeeded, store the registration response                 AuthState state = new AuthState(resp);                 //proceed to authorization...             } else {               // registration failed, check ex for more details             }          }     }); ```  ## Utilizing client secrets (DANGEROUS)  We _strongly recommend_ you avoid using static client secrets in your native applications whenever possible. Client secrets derived via a dynamic client registration are safe to use, but static client secrets can be easily extracted from your apps and allow others to impersonate your app and steal user data. If client secrets must be used by the OAuth2 provider you are integrating with, we strongly recommend performing the code exchange step on your backend, where the client secret can be kept hidden.  Having said this, in some cases using client secrets is unavoidable. In these cases, a [ClientAuthentication](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-Android/blob/master/library/java/net/openid/appauth/ClientAuthentication.java) instance can be provided to AppAuth when performing a token request. This allows additional parameters (both HTTP headers and request body parameters) to be added to token requests. Two standard implementations of ClientAuthentication are provided:  - [ClientSecretBasic](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-Android/blob/master/library/java/net/openid/appauth/ClientSecretBasic.java):   includes a client ID and client secret as an HTTP Basic Authorization header. - [ClientSecretPost](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-Android/blob/master/library/java/net/openid/appauth/ClientSecretPost.java):   includes a client ID and client secret as additional request parameters.  So, in order to send a token request using HTTP basic authorization, one would write:  ```java ClientAuthentication clientAuth = new ClientSecretBasic(MY_CLIENT_SECRET); TokenRequest req = ...; authService.performTokenRequest(req, clientAuth, callback); ```  This can also be done when using `performActionWithFreshTokens` on AuthState:  ```java ClientAuthentication clientAuth = new ClientSecretPost(MY_CLIENT_SECRET); authState.performActionWithFreshTokens(     authService,     clientAuth,     action); ```  ## Modifying or contributing to AppAuth  This project requires the Android SDK for API level 25 (Nougat) to build, though the produced binaries only require API level 16 (Jellybean) to be used. We recommend that you fork and/or clone this repository to make modifications; downloading the source has been known to cause some developers problems.  For contributors, see the additional instructions in [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-Android/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).  ### Building from the Command line  AppAuth for Android uses Gradle as its build system. In order to build the library and app binaries, run `./gradlew assemble`. The library AAR files are output to `library/build/outputs/aar`, while the demo app is output to `app/build/outputs/apk`. In order to run the tests and code analysis, run `./gradlew check`.  ### Building from Android Studio  In AndroidStudio, File -> New -> Import project. Select the root folder (the one with the `build.gradle` file).",

        "description": "Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning have empowered our lives to a large extent. The number of advancements made in this space has revolutionized our society and continue making society a better place to live in.  In terms of perception, both Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are often used in the same context which leads to confusion. AI is the concept in which machine makes smart decisions whereas Machine Learning is a sub-field of AI which makes decisions while learning patterns from the input data.  In this blog, we would dissect each term and understand how Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are related to each other.  What is Artificial Intelligence? The term Artificial Intelligence was recognized first in the year 1956 by John Mccarthy in an AI conference.  In layman terms, Artificial Intelligence is about creating intelligent machines which could perform human-like actions. AI is not a modern-day phenomenon. In fact, it has been around since the advent of computers. The only thing that has changed is how we perceive AI and define its applications in the present world.  The exponential growth of AI in the last decade or so has affected every sphere of our lives. Starting from a simple google search which gives the best results of a query to the creation of Siri or Alexa, one of the significant breakthroughs of the 21st century is Artificial Intelligence.  The Four types of Artificial Intelligence are:-  Reactive AI \u2013 This type of AI lacks historical data to perform actions, and completely reacts to a certain action taken at the moment. It works on the principle of Deep Reinforcement learning where a prize is awarded for any successful action and penalized vice versa. Google\u2019s AlphaGo defeated experts in Go using this approach. Limited Memory \u2013 In the case of the limited memory, the past data is kept on adding to the memory. For example, in the case of selecting the best restaurant, the past locations would be taken into account and would be suggested accordingly. Theory of Mind \u2013 Such type of AI is yet to be built as it involves dealing with human emotions, and psychology. Face and gesture detection comes close but nothing advanced enough to understand human emotions. Self-Aware \u2013 This is the future advancement of AI which could configure self-representations. The machines could be conscious, and super-intelligent.    Two of the most common usage of AI is in the field of Computer Vision, and Natural Language Processing.  Computer Vision is the study of identifying objects such as Face Recognition, Real-time object detection, and so on. Detection of such movements could go a long way in analyzing the sentiments conveyed by a human being.  Natural Language Processing, on the other hand, deals with textual data to extract insights or sentiments from it. From ChatBot Development to Speech Recognition like Amazon\u2019s Alexa or Apple\u2019s Siri all uses Natural Language to extract relevant meaning from the data. It is one of the widely popular fields of AI which has found its usefulness in every organization.  One other application of AI which has gained popularity in recent times is the self-driving cars. It uses reinforcement learning technique to learn its best moves and identify the restrictions or blockage in front of the road. Many automobile companies are gradually adopting the concept of self-driving cars.     What is Machine Learning? Machine Learning is a state-of-the-art subset of Artificial Intelligence which let machines learn from past data, and make accurate predictions.  Machine Learning has been around for decades, and the first ML application that got popular was the Email Spam Filter Classification. The system is trained with a set of emails labeled as \u2018spam\u2019 and \u2018not spam\u2019 known as the training instance. Then a new set of unknown emails is fed to the trained system which then categorizes it as \u2018spam\u2019 or \u2018not spam.\u2019  All these predictions are made by a certain group of Regression, and Classification algorithms like \u2013 Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, and so on. The usability of these algorithms varies based on the problem statement and the data set in operation.  Along with these basic algorithms, a sub-field of Machine Learning which has gained immense popularity in recent times is Deep Learning. However, Deep Learning requires enormous computational power and works best with a massive amount of data. It uses neural networks whose architecture is similar to the human brain.  Machine Learning could be subdivided into three categories \u2013  Supervised Learning \u2013 In supervised learning problems, both the input feature and the corresponding target variable is present in the dataset. Unsupervised Learning \u2013 The dataset is not labeled in an unsupervised learning problem i.e., only the input features are present, but not the target variable. The algorithms need to find out the separate clusters in the dataset based on certain patterns. Reinforcement Learning \u2013 In this type of problems, the learner is rewarded with a prize for every correct move, and penalized for every incorrect move. The application of Machine Learning is diversified in various domains like Banking, Healthcare, Retail, etc.  One of the use cases in the banking industry is predicting the probability of credit loan default by a borrower given its past transactions, credit history, debt ratio, annual income, and so on. In Healthcare, Machine Learning is often been used to predict patient\u2019s stay in the hospital, the likelihood of occurrence of a disease, identifying abnormal patterns in the cell, etc.  Many software companies have incorporated Machine Learning in their workflow to steadfast the process of testing. Various manual, repetitive tasks are being replaced by machine learning models.  Comparison Between AI and Machine Learning Machine Learning is the subset of Artificial Intelligence which has taken the advancement in AI to a whole new level. The thought behind letting the computer learn from themselves and voluminous data that are getting generated from various sources in the present world has led to the emergence of Machine Learning.  In Machine Learning, the concept of neural networks plays a significant role in allowing the system to learn from themselves as well as maintaining its speed, and accuracy. The group of neural nets lets a model rectifying its prior decision and make a more accurate prediction next time.  Artificial Intelligence is about acquiring knowledge and applying them to ensure success instead of accuracy. It makes the computer intelligent to make smart decisions on its own akin to the decisions made by a human being. The more complex the problem is, the better it is for AI to solve the complexity.  On the other hand, Machine Learning is mostly about acquiring knowledge and maintaining better accuracy instead of success. The primary aim is to learn from the data to automate specific tasks.  The possibilities around Machine Learning and Neural Networks are endless. A set of sentiments could be understood from raw text. A machine learning application could also listen to music, and even play a piece of appropriate music based on a person\u2019s mood. NLP, a field of AI which has made some ground-breaking innovations in recent years uses Machine Learning to understand the nuances in natural language and learn to respond accordingly.  Different sectors like banking, healthcare, manufacturing, etc., are reaping the benefits of Artificial Intelligence, particularly Machine Learning. Several tedious tasks are getting automated through ML which saves both time and money.  Machine Learning has been sold these days consistently by marketers even before it has reached its full potential. AI could be seen as something of the old by the marketers who believe Machine Learning is the Holy Grail in the field of analytics.  The future is not far when we would see human-like AI. The rapid advancement in technology has taken us closer than ever before to inevitability. The recent progress in the working AI is much down to how Machine Learning operates.  Both Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning has its own business applications and its usage is completely dependent on the requirements of an organization. AI is an age-old concept with Machine Learning picking up the pace in recent times. Companies like TCS, Infosys are yet to unleash the full potential of Machine Learning and trying to incorporate ML in their applications to keep pace with the rapidly growing Analytics space.  Conclusion The hype around Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are such that various companies and even individuals want to master the skills without even knowing the difference between the two. Often both the terms are misused in the same context.  To master Machine Learning, one needs to have a natural intuition about the data, ask the right questions, and find out the correct algorithms to use to build a model. It often doesn\u2019t requiem how computational capacity.  On the other hand, AI is about building intelligent systems which require advanced tools and techniques and often used in big companies like Google, Facebook, etc.  There is a whole host of resources to master Machine Learning and AI. The Data Science blogs of Dimensionless is a good place to start with.  Also, There are Online Data Science Courses which cover the various nitty gritty of Machine Learning.",

Recommended text editors: [Atom](https://atom.io), [Brackets](https://brackets.io), [Vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) * Offline server ([xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) or [wamp](http://www.wampserver.com/en/))  ## Workflow This section describes the workflow we are going to follow when working in a new feature or fixing a bug. If you want to contribute, please follow these steps:  #### Fork this project Clone the forked project to your local environment, for example: ```git clone https://github.com/DSCfuo/fuocribs.git ``` (Make sure to replace the URL to your own repository). Add the original project as a remote, for this example the name is upstream, feel free to use whatever name you want. git remote add upstream ```https://github.com/DSCfuo/fuocribs.git ``` Forking the project will create a copy of that project in your own GitHub account, you will commit your work against your own repository.  #### Updating your local In order to update your local environment to the latest version on master, you will have to pull the changes using the upstream repository, for example: git pull upstream master. This will pull all the new commits from the origin repository to your local environment.  #### Features/Bugs When working on a new feature, create a new branch feature/something from the master branch, for example feature/login-form. Commit your work against this new branch and push everything to your forked project. Once everything is completed, you should create a pull request to the original project. Make sure to add a description about your work and a link to the trello task.  When fixing a bug, create a new branch fix/something from the master branch, for example fix/css-btn-issues. When completed, push your commits to your forked repository and create a pull request from there. Please make sure to describe what was the problem and how did you fix it.  #### Updating your local branch Let's say you've been working on a feature for a couple days, most likely there are new changes in master and your branch is behind. In order to update it to the latest (You might not need/want to do this) you need to pull the latest changes to develop and then rebase your current branch.  $ git checkout master $ git pull upstream master $ git checkout feature/something-awesome $ git rebase master After this, your commits will be on top of the master commits. From here you can push to your origin repository and create a pull request.  You might have some conflicts while rebasing, try to resolve the conflicts for each individual commit. Rebasing is intimidating at the beginning, if you need help don't be afraid to reach out in slack.  #### Pull requests In order to merge a pull request, there should be a couple of approval reviews. Once is approved, we should merge to the master branch using the Squash button in github.  When using squash, all the commits will be squashed into one. The idea is to merge features/fixes as oppose of merging each individual commit. This helps when looking back in time for changes in the code base, and if the pull request has a great comment, it's easier to know why that code was introduced.",

        "description": "Tirana transit is a real time  journey planning application for the iOS platform. It is focused precisely on the public transport operating in Tirana. Using the GPS technology and the integrated map features users can see their current location and all the station around them. The location of the stations will be registered by me and it is achieved by providing the coordinates.   Users will be able to get the schedule for specific stations of a line, get the next stops in real time. The app sends notifications for their departures and users can see the connections that the current station offers with different lines. You can see all the stations of a line in the map as well. This will be implemented by using the drawing methods the swift languages provide.  Moreover, there are alerts in case of traffic disruptions. The alert will be line specific and it will pop up as a notification in the users screen.   A full network map image will be provided in order for users to see for themselves the connections and routes.  Users will be able to login and buy their tickets via the app which will avoid having a line of people waiting to buy a ticket from the driver. The ticket implementation will be done via Stripe an online service. The workflow is as follows:    Collecting credit card information from your customer Converting the credit card information to a single-use token Sending this token to your server to create a charge.  The login will be implemented by using parse in order to save the user data. Parse offers an online database storage and it is efficient for projects of this size. A chat may be provided to contact the support for any issues.   There are two courses that I am mainly interested in apart from software engineering. These are namely database and information systems, network security. Both offered in the masters program. I need the database for the user information as I already mention and the system has to be secure when it comes to making payments. I believe they are an integral part when it comes to designing software because you want your product to be as much reliable and efficient as possible. This would allow me to improve my application.",
