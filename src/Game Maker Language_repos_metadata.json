        "description": "A list of practical projects that anyone can solve in any programming language (See solutions). These projects are divided into multiple categories, and each category has its own folder.  To get started, simply fork this repo.  CONTRIBUTING See ways of contributing to this repo. You can contribute solutions (will be published in this repo) to existing problems, add new projects, or remove existing ones. Make sure you follow all instructions properly.  Solutions You can find implementations of these projects in many other languages by other users in this repo.  Credits  Problems are motivated by the ones shared at:  Martyr2\u2019s Mega Project List Rosetta Code Table of Contents Numbers Classic Algorithms Graph Data Structures Text Networking Classes Threading Web Files Databases Graphics and Multimedia Security Numbers Find PI to the Nth Digit - Enter a number and have the program generate PI up to that many decimal places. Keep a limit to how far the program will go.  Find e to the Nth Digit - Just like the previous problem, but with e instead of PI. Enter a number and have the program generate e up to that many decimal places. Keep a limit to how far the program will go.  Fibonacci Sequence - Enter a number and have the program generate the Fibonacci sequence to that number or to the Nth number.  Prime Factorization - Have the user enter a number and find all Prime Factors (if there are any) and display them.  Next Prime Number - Have the program find prime numbers until the user chooses to stop asking for the next one.  Find Cost of Tile to Cover W x H Floor - Calculate the total cost of the tile it would take to cover a floor plan of width and height, using a cost entered by the user.  Mortgage Calculator - Calculate the monthly payments of a fixed-term mortgage over given Nth terms at a given interest rate. Also, figure out how long it will take the user to pay back the loan. For added complexity, add an option for users to select the compounding interval (Monthly, Weekly, Daily, Continually).  Change Return Program - The user enters a cost and then the amount of money given. The program will figure out the change and the number of quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies needed for the change.  Binary to Decimal and Back Converter - Develop a converter to convert a decimal number to binary or a binary number to its decimal equivalent.  Calculator - A simple calculator to do basic operators. Make it a scientific calculator for added complexity.  Unit Converter (temp, currency, volume, mass, and more) - Converts various units between one another. The user enters the type of unit being entered, the type of unit they want to convert to, and then the value. The program will then make the conversion.  Alarm Clock - A simple clock where it plays a sound after X number of minutes/seconds or at a particular time.  Distance Between Two Cities - Calculates the distance between two cities and allows the user to specify a unit of distance. This program may require finding coordinates for the cities like latitude and longitude.  Credit Card Validator - Takes in a credit card number from a common credit card vendor (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discoverer) and validates it to make sure that it is a valid number (look into how credit cards use a checksum).  Tax Calculator - Asks the user to enter a cost and either a country or state tax. It then returns the tax plus the total cost with tax.  Factorial Finder - The Factorial of a positive integer, n, is defined as the product of the sequence n, n-1, n-2, ...1, and the factorial of zero, 0, is defined as being 1. Solve this using both loops and recursion.  Complex Number Algebra - Show addition, multiplication, negation, and inversion of complex numbers in separate functions. (Subtraction and division operations can be made with pairs of these operations.) Print the results for each operation tested.  Happy Numbers - A happy number is defined by the following process. Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers, while those that do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers. Display an example of your output here. Find the first 8 happy numbers.  Number Names - Show how to spell out a number in English. You can use a preexisting implementation or roll your own, but you should support inputs up to at least one million (or the maximum value of your language's default bounded integer type if that's less). Optional: Support for inputs other than positive integers (like zero, negative integers, and floating-point numbers).  Coin Flip Simulation - Write some code that simulates flipping a single coin however many times the user decides. The code should record the outcomes and count the number of tails and heads.  Limit Calculator - Ask the user to enter f(x) and the limit value, then return the value of the limit statement Optional: Make the calculator capable of supporting infinite limits.  Fast Exponentiation - Ask the user to enter 2 integers a and b and output a^b (i.e. pow(a,b)) in O(LG n) time complexity.  Classic Algorithms Collatz Conjecture - Start with a number n > 1. Find the number of steps it takes to reach one using the following process: If n is even, divide it by 2. If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.  Sorting - Implement two types of sorting algorithms: Merge sort and bubble sort.  Closest pair problem - The closest pair of points problem or closest pair problem is a problem of computational geometry: given n points in metric space, find a pair of points with the smallest distance between them.

An Eulerian cycle is an eulerian Path that starts and finishes at the same node.  Connected Graph - Create a program that takes a graph as an input and outputs whether every node is connected or not.  Dijkstra\u2019s Algorithm - Create a program that finds the shortest path through a graph using its edges.

Data Structures Inverted index - An Inverted Index is a data structure used to create full-text search. Given a set of text files, implement a program to create an inverted index. Also, create a user interface to do a search using that inverted index which returns a list of files that contain the query term/terms. The search index can be in memory.  Text Fizz Buzz - Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print \u201cFizz\u201d instead of the number and for the multiples of five print \u201cBuzz\u201d. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print \u201cFizzBuzz\u201d.  Reverse a String - Enter a string and the program will reverse it and print it out.  Pig Latin - Pig Latin is a game of alterations played in the English language game. To create the Pig Latin form of an English word the initial consonant sound is transposed to the end of the word and an ay is affixed (Ex.: \"banana\" would yield anana-bay). Read Wikipedia for more information on rules.  Count Vowels - Enter a string and the program counts the number of vowels in the text. For added complexity have it report a sum of each vowel found.  Check if Palindrome - Checks if the string entered by the user is a palindrome.

Optional: Try adding various effects like fade in/out, star wipe, and window blinds transitions.  Stream Video from Online - Try to create your own online streaming video player.  Mp3 Player - A simple program for playing your favorite music files. Add features you think are missing from your favorite music player.  Watermarking Application - Have some pictures you want copyright protected? Add your own logo or text lightly across the background so that no one can simply steal your graphics off your site. Make a program that will add this watermark to the picture. Optional: Use threading to process multiple images simultaneously.  Turtle Graphics - This is a common project where you create a floor of 20 x 20 squares. Using various commands you tell a turtle to draw a line on the floor. You have moved forward, left or right, lift or drop the pen, etc. Do a search online for \"Turtle Graphics\" for more information. Optional: Allow the program to read in the list of commands from a file.  GIF Creator A program that puts together multiple images (PNGs, JPGs, TIFFs) to make a smooth GIF that can be exported. Optional: Make the program convert small video files to GIFs as well.  Security Caesar cipher - Implement a Caesar cipher, both encoding, and decoding. The key is an integer from 1 to 25. This cipher rotates the letters of the alphabet (A to Z). The encoding replaces each letter with the 1st to 25th next letter in the alphabet (wrapping Z to A). So key 2 encrypts \"HI\" to \"JK\", but key 20 encrypts \"HI\" to \"BC\". This simple \"monoalphabetic substitution cipher\" provides almost no security, because an attacker who has the encoded message can either use frequency analysis to guess the key, or just try all 25 keys.",
