        "description": "A list of practical projects that anyone can solve in any programming language (See solutions). These projects are divided into multiple categories, and each category has its own folder.  To get started, simply fork this repo.  CONTRIBUTING See ways of contributing to this repo. You can contribute solutions (will be published in this repo) to existing problems, add new projects, or remove existing ones. Make sure you follow all instructions properly.  Solutions You can find implementations of these projects in many other languages by other users in this repo.  Credits  Problems are motivated by the ones shared at:  Martyr2\u2019s Mega Project List Rosetta Code Table of Contents Numbers Classic Algorithms Graph Data Structures Text Networking Classes Threading Web Files Databases Graphics and Multimedia Security Numbers Find PI to the Nth Digit - Enter a number and have the program generate PI up to that many decimal places. Keep a limit to how far the program will go.  Find e to the Nth Digit - Just like the previous problem, but with e instead of PI. Enter a number and have the program generate e up to that many decimal places. Keep a limit to how far the program will go.  Fibonacci Sequence - Enter a number and have the program generate the Fibonacci sequence to that number or to the Nth number.  Prime Factorization - Have the user enter a number and find all Prime Factors (if there are any) and display them.  Next Prime Number - Have the program find prime numbers until the user chooses to stop asking for the next one.  Find Cost of Tile to Cover W x H Floor - Calculate the total cost of the tile it would take to cover a floor plan of width and height, using a cost entered by the user.  Mortgage Calculator - Calculate the monthly payments of a fixed-term mortgage over given Nth terms at a given interest rate. Also, figure out how long it will take the user to pay back the loan. For added complexity, add an option for users to select the compounding interval (Monthly, Weekly, Daily, Continually).  Change Return Program - The user enters a cost and then the amount of money given. The program will figure out the change and the number of quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies needed for the change.  Binary to Decimal and Back Converter - Develop a converter to convert a decimal number to binary or a binary number to its decimal equivalent.  Calculator - A simple calculator to do basic operators. Make it a scientific calculator for added complexity.  Unit Converter (temp, currency, volume, mass, and more) - Converts various units between one another. The user enters the type of unit being entered, the type of unit they want to convert to, and then the value. The program will then make the conversion.  Alarm Clock - A simple clock where it plays a sound after X number of minutes/seconds or at a particular time.  Distance Between Two Cities - Calculates the distance between two cities and allows the user to specify a unit of distance. This program may require finding coordinates for the cities like latitude and longitude.  Credit Card Validator - Takes in a credit card number from a common credit card vendor (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discoverer) and validates it to make sure that it is a valid number (look into how credit cards use a checksum).  Tax Calculator - Asks the user to enter a cost and either a country or state tax. It then returns the tax plus the total cost with tax.  Factorial Finder - The Factorial of a positive integer, n, is defined as the product of the sequence n, n-1, n-2, ...1, and the factorial of zero, 0, is defined as being 1. Solve this using both loops and recursion.  Complex Number Algebra - Show addition, multiplication, negation, and inversion of complex numbers in separate functions. (Subtraction and division operations can be made with pairs of these operations.) Print the results for each operation tested.  Happy Numbers - A happy number is defined by the following process. Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers, while those that do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers. Display an example of your output here. Find the first 8 happy numbers.  Number Names - Show how to spell out a number in English. You can use a preexisting implementation or roll your own, but you should support inputs up to at least one million (or the maximum value of your language's default bounded integer type if that's less). Optional: Support for inputs other than positive integers (like zero, negative integers, and floating-point numbers).  Coin Flip Simulation - Write some code that simulates flipping a single coin however many times the user decides. The code should record the outcomes and count the number of tails and heads.

Make a program that will add this watermark to the picture. Optional: Use threading to process multiple images simultaneously.  Turtle Graphics - This is a common project where you create a floor of 20 x 20 squares. Using various commands you tell a turtle to draw a line on the floor. You have moved forward, left or right, lift or drop the pen, etc. Do a search online for \"Turtle Graphics\" for more information. Optional: Allow the program to read in the list of commands from a file.  GIF Creator A program that puts together multiple images (PNGs, JPGs, TIFFs) to make a smooth GIF that can be exported. Optional: Make the program convert small video files to GIFs as well.  Security Caesar cipher - Implement a Caesar cipher, both encoding, and decoding. The key is an integer from 1 to 25. This cipher rotates the letters of the alphabet (A to Z). The encoding replaces each letter with the 1st to 25th next letter in the alphabet (wrapping Z to A). So key 2 encrypts \"HI\" to \"JK\", but key 20 encrypts \"HI\" to \"BC\". This simple \"monoalphabetic substitution cipher\" provides almost no security, because an attacker who has the encoded message can either use frequency analysis to guess the key, or just try all 25 keys.",

If computers experience life through their own senses, they cease to be purely a means to an end determined by their usefulness to... humans. Per GNW [the Global Neuronal Workspace theory], they turn from mere objects into subjects... with a point of view.... Once computers' cognitive abilities rival those of humanity, their impulse to push for legal and political rights will become irresistible \u2013 the right not to be deleted, not to have their memories wiped clean, not to suffer pain and degradation.

        "name": "BRANDING-FOR-WOMEN-A-KEY-IN-EVERY-MARKETING-STRATEGY",
        "description": "A woman\u2019s experience with a brand, whether it\u2019s physical or digital, can echo through your target audience far and beyond a singular touchpoint. This is not only due to their nature of sharing their experiences with a brand. Women tend to be the financial decision-makers in households, and they also happen to control the majority of spending in general. Considering this, paying attention to their responses towards the marketing efforts should become a priority, and if you\u2019re ignoring this, you are doing yourself a disservice.  Marti Barletta, the author of Marketing to Women, concluded through her studies that women are the primary decision-makers for consumer goods in 85% of households. Why do women have this purchasing power? It\u2019s not necessarily because of their breadwinner status. Even if they don\u2019t represent the main source of income in the family, the decision of choosing a brand is still placed in their hands, whether its groceries, clothing, or electronics goods and beyond.  Women have always been an essential factor within successful branding strategies, regardless if it was officially recognized or not. It is only recently, through this seismic cultural change that we are experiencing regarding women\u2019s position as leaders in the world, that we recognize their growing influence in the marketplace and thus companies have started to pay more attention to the way they are communicating with the female market.  Barletta explains the differences between women and men regarding the decision of purchasing: \"Men and women don't communicate in the same way, and they don't buy for the same reasons. \"He simply wants the transaction to take place. She's interested in creating a relationship. \"Every place women go, they make connections\u2026 91% of women say 'Advertisers don't understand us'.\" Why do women feel misunderstood? Probably because, preponderant, men are in control of the industries, and they are totally, hopelessly, clueless about women. Faith Popcorn, one of America's consumer trend experts, says: \"Companies think they're marketing to women - but they're not. They're not talking to women. They don't know how to talk to women. They really don't realize that women have a separate language and a separate way of being.\"  So how should a brand communicate efficiently to the women market?  First of all, it\u2019s important to understand that, by living in this age where activism reached an unprecedented scale against all types of inequality and women especially have an entire empowering movement, the brand they choose to buy is an extension of their values. Only by comparing men and women at an emotional level we can understand that women care more about the brands they pick to buy. They don\u2019t make just a transaction. Women do their homework, they feel the message the brand wants to transmit and they either step away from it or become loyal if their values align. Women are more likely to remember the ads they see, details about the reputation of a company, and they pay more attention to how a brand speaks to them, if the brand truly cares about their needs and wants.  One bad example regarding branding for women is the universal \u201cshrink it and pink it\u201d, a marketing strategy that, in order to communicate that a product is made for women, they simply make the products pink, usually smaller than the \u201cmale version\u201d, and also cost more, known as \u201cpink-tax\u201d. The reaction to this strategy is that women have started buying the \u201cmale version\u201d of those products.   Bic has made such a mistake by making \u201cpens for her\u201d, the only difference between normal pens and the \u201cfemale version\u201d being the color and the extra cost. The reaction of women? Ellen Degeneres highlighted everything that\u2019s wrong about it:  Bic Pens for Women from The Ellen Show  A fact that needs to be understood is that women don\u2019t make decisions based purely on the aesthetic. Yes, it has an important place, but it\u2019s not crucial. Just because it\u2019s pink doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re going to love it. Such superficial approaches won\u2019t work.  Bridget Brennan, the author of \u201cWhy She Buys\u201d, said \u201cPink is not a strategy, unless you\u2019re raising money for breast cancer research. \u201cIn 2016, marketing to women is all about being inclusive. That doesn\u2019t mean excluding men; it means excluding stereotypes.\u201d  What it\u2019s crucial to on focus instead is empowering women. Through history, women have been under a lot of pressure regarding how they should look, speak, act. From how they should dress and take care of their body, to what they should choose to do with their life, women have been under the coercion of other\u2019s expectations. A feminine approach should not be patronizing, but empowering, giving them the liberation of choosing. Empowering options that facilitate choice, individuality and true progress are what the future should offer them.  Billie is a perfect example of a company that succeeded in addressing its female audience intelligently. Being a razor company, they could be considered on a tricky ground where it\u2019s easy to fall into the mistake of telling women what they should do in order to conform to the beauty standards. Even so, Billie succeeded in addressing this problem by changing the angle. Their provocative ad successfully communicated that their razors are designed by women for women, and the company perfectly understands the needs and wants of women. Billie doesn\u2019t put any pressure on the female market to shave their hair not pretend that it is not there. They make it clear that there\u2019s no beauty standard that women should follow, and they let the decisions of shaving to be consciously made without any outside pressure. \u201cHair, everyone has it, even women. The world pretends it doesn't exist, but it does. We checked. So, however, if ever, you want to shave, we'll be here\u201d.  Project Body Hair by Billie  As conclusion, women want to see more than something pretty. They feel the message a brand transmits differently, they care much more about the little details than men, and since they have more purchasing power, marketers should put more effort into understanding the layers they need to touch in order to communicate efficiently to women if they don\u2019t want to be left behind in long-term.",

        "description": "ANALYZING ROAD SAFETY & TRAFFIC DEMOGRAPHICS IN THE UK (Multi-class Classification) SUMMARY Here, I am aim to analyze the Road Safety and Traffic Demographics dataset (UK), containing accidents reported by the police between the years of 2004 - 2017.  PROJECT GOALS: Identify factors responsible for most of the reported accidents. Build a machine learning model that is capable of accurately predicting the severity of an accident. Provide recommendations to the Department of Transport (UK Government), to improve road safety policies and prevent recurrences of severe accidents where possible. PACKAGES USED: Scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, imblearn (imbalanced-learn), seaborn, Matplotlib MOTIVATION World Health Organization (WHO) reported that more than 1.25 million people die each year while 50 million are injured as a result of road accidents worldwide. Road accidents are the 10th leading cause of death globally. On current trends, road traffic accidents are to become the 7th leading cause of death by 2030 making it a major public health concern. Between the years 2005 and 2016, there were roughly 2 million road accidents reported in the United Kingdom (UK) alone of which 16,000 were fatal.  As a big data project, I wanted to explore the traffic demographics data in greater detail using machine learning!  CONTEXT The UK government amassed traffic data from 2004 to 2017, recording over 2 million accidents in the process and making this one of the most comprehensive traffic data sets out there. It's a huge picture of a country undergoing change.  Note that all the contained accident data comes from police reports, so this data does not include minor incidents.  For steps undertaken to pre-process and clean the data, please view the \"Data Cleansing & Descriptive Analysis_UK Traffic Demographics.ipynb\" file DESCRIPTIVE ANALYTICS (EDA) Tools used include Python, Tableau, MS PowerBI Percent (%) distribution of target classes Percent dist of Accident Severity  As seen above, the data is highly imbalanced.  For detailed steps undertaken to deal with the imbalanced data, please view the \"Modelling_Predictive Analytics_UK Traffic Demographics.ipynb\" file. This article provides some great tips on utilizing the correct performance metrics when analyzing a models performance trained on an imbalanced dataset.  This article describes several strategies that can help combat the case of a severly imbalanced dataset. Methods include:  Resampling strategies (under - Tomek Links, Cluster Centroids, over sampling - SMOTE) Using Decision Tree based models Using Cost-Sensitive training (Penalize algorithms) Number of accidents by Year and Accident Severity Total accidents by year and severity  It can be seen above that the trend seems to be increasing as the years go. In addition, the spike between 2008 - 2009 was because of a enhancement in the reporting system introduced in the UK in 2009, where all accident including minor accidents needed to be reported by the police so as to match the counts represented by hospitals, insurance claims etc.  Accidents density by Location geomap  Most accidents took place in major cities - Birmingham, London, leeds, Newcastle  Accidents by Gender and Age Accidents by gender and age  Accidents by Day of the week and Year Accidents by year and weekday  Most accidents take place on a Friday  Vehicle Manoever at time of accident Vehicle Manoever at time of accident  Most accidents take place as a result of overtaking  For more findings, please go to the \"Images\" folder. For steps undertaken to carry out some predictive modeling and hyper-parameter tuning, please view the \"Modelling_Predictive Analytics_UK Traffic Demographics.ipynb\" file. RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORT (UK) Decrease emergency response times during afternoon rush-hours (15-19) especially on Fridays. Allocate resources to investigate high density traffic points and identify new infrastructure needs to divert traffic from dual-carriage ways. Explore conditions of vehicles and casualties such as vehicle type, age of vehicles registered, pedestrian movements, etc. for policy makers. Adopt comprehensive distracted driving laws that increase penalties for drivers who commit traffic violations like aggressive overtaking. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The license for this dataset is the Open Givernment Licence used by all data on data.gov.uk. The raw datasets are available from the UK Department of Transport website.  I had a lot of fun working on this dataset and learned a lot in the process. I plan to further my research in the area of predictive modeling using imabalanced data and how to effectively build a highly robust model for future projects.

That's when we realised the inconvenience of watching series with audio in some  other language and simultaneously reading the subtitles in English. So BAMM!! that's when the idea struck us, hence the dubcon.  What Dubcon does? Dubcon is the webapp which takes videos present in the other language and english subtitles for the same video. It then returns the video with English audio.  Why the need of Dubcon? In our daily browsing we come across many videos which are not originally present in the language we understand. This gap prevents us from enjoying the digital content. With dubcon we are trying to take a huge step to reduce the gap.In today's world,their is the huge process of releasing same video in multiple languages(dubbing) costing considerable amount to the film makers. With Dubcon we are trying to reduce the steps and cost required for dubbing.  How? It is required to have audio,video and subtitle file in sync. Subtitle should be in english language only,it  doesn't matter what type of audio language it is in. Then the given subs gets converted to audio with the help of text to speech and the timings of the audio are matched so as to fit the given portions of video ,so that their is no delay or time error in audio and video sync time. Then the output file gets downloaded to users desktop after it is converted.  Future scope: --> Their will be multilanguage support for the webapp i.e you can convert from any language to any language of     your choice. --> Further optimization will be done to reduce the processing time of the conversion process. --> Audio processing will take place which will try to match the frequency and pitch of the given audio     so that the converted files looks more realistic without loosing original speakers attributes. --> This will be converted as a video player which will be an integrated function of convertion of one language     to another. --> security of the webpage will be improved(this one is just the prototype). --> Further we will try to remove constraints like need of subtitles and audio and video sync. --> Improved UI,functionality and ML based audio translator in future updates.  AIM: people should be able to enjoy any content at any language they feel like.  ",

Idea of doing things automatic using sensor and actuators, simple task that can be control over microcontroller, getting idea of c coding and basic understanding of hardware   What is Microcontroller?  Roll of microcontroller doing anything automatic, how microcontroller helps to do those things simple. A microcontroller is often small and low cost. The components are chosen to minimize size and to be as inexpensive as possible.  What they use before Arduino board? Before innovation of Arduino people are working on different microcontroller which are not more efficient, easy and open\u2013sources like Arduino. 4004 8085, 8086,8051 are first processors and controller  What is Arduino?  Arduino is an open-source platform used for building electronics projects. Arduino consists of both a physical programmable circuit board (often referred to as a microcontroller) and a piece of software, or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that runs on your computer, used to write and upload computer code to the physical board. Arduino boards The Arduino platform has become quite popular with people just starting out with electronics, and for good reason. Unlike most previous programmable circuit boards, the Arduino does not need a separate piece of hardware (called a programmer) in order to load new code onto the board -- you can simply use a USB cable  How does the Arduino Uno board work and why it's so  The Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software used to build electronics projects. All Arduino boards have one thing in common which is a microcontroller. A microcontroller is basically a really small computer. With the Arduino, makers and electricians can easily prototype their products and make their ideas come to life.  How to use the Arduino IDE If you want to program your Arduino Uno while offline you need to install the Arduino Desktop IDE The Uno is programmed using the Arduino Software (IDE), our Integrated Development Environment common to all our boards. Before you can move on, you must have installed the Arduino Software (IDE) on your PC, as explained in the home page of our Getting Started.  How to use the Arduino IDE coding Arduino programs are written in the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Arduino IDE is a special software running on your system that allows you to write sketches (synonym for program in Arduino language) for different Arduino boards. The Arduino programming language is based on a very simple hardware programming language called processing, which is similar to the C language. After the sketch is written in the Arduino IDE, it should be uploaded on the Arduino board for execution.  The first step in programming the Arduino board is downloading and installing the Arduino IDE. The open source Arduino IDE runs on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. Download the Arduino software (depending on your OS) from the official website and follow the instructions to install.",

In any case, utilizing a similar language style for your whole video would seem like way of talking or static. It isn't required that you want a legitimate studio to record your recordings. You could require a camera, mount, lights, mouthpieces, subtitle software and then some. In any case, regardless, you may not require these apparatuses. Your cell phone would be sufficient to shoot the video to start with. You can pick a room that has a quiet climate and great light. In the event that you are timid or unfit to record rational sound for your recordings and free subtitle download, you can take the assistance of that can peruse out your content in a style, tone, and language of your inclination. Furthermore, you should not recruit sound voice entertainers for your There are a lot of savvy techniques to alter your recordings, make proficient recordings, and convey these recordings to an overall crowd.

They are a decent option to add text to video online free no watermark in the spot of costly receivers, DSLRs, and different cameras. In the wake of figuring out the camera and sound, presently it is the right time to discuss lights. You don't have to break your bank to fabricate a studio with every one of the heavenly lights and climate. Getting electrical ropes and a couple of lights with bulbs would finish the work of audio transcript generator. A large portion of the substance makers utilize the three lights stand, which is accessible online at on some other internet based retailer. The three-light stand is a conventional arrangement for video lights as it tosses light in an essential strategy for getting around the subject. It likewise assists with making a delicate light that guarantees your issue seems to be the camera's ideal. You can evaluate various points as per your need to auto transcript audio to text, yet putting at a 45 \uff9f point to the left or the right of the subject and setting the light over the head and some way downwards would work effectively.
