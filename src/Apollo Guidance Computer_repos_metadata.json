        "description": "using Neural Networks (SSD) on Tensorflow.  This repo documents steps and scripts used to train a hand detector using Tensorflow (Object Detection API). As with any DNN based task, the most expensive (and riskiest) part of the process has to do with finding or creating the right (annotated) dataset. I was interested mainly in detecting hands on a table (egocentric view point). I experimented first with the [Oxford Hands Dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/hands/) (the results were not good). I then tried the [Egohands Dataset](http://vision.soic.indiana.edu/projects/egohands/) which was a much better fit to my requirements.  The goal of this repo/post is to demonstrate how neural networks can be applied to the (hard) problem of tracking hands (egocentric and other views). Better still, provide code that can be adapted to other uses cases.  If you use this tutorial or models in your research or project, please cite [this](#citing-this-tutorial).

Using a different version may result in [some errors](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/issues/1581). You may need to [generate your own frozen model](https://pythonprogramming.net/testing-custom-object-detector-tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial/?completed=/training-custom-objects-tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial/) graph using the [model checkpoints](model-checkpoint) in the repo to fit your TF version.    **Content of this document** - Motivation - Why Track/Detect hands with Neural Networks - Data preparation and network training in Tensorflow (Dataset, Import, Training) - Training the hand detection Model - Using the Detector to Detect/Track hands - Thoughts on Optimizations.  > P.S if you are using or have used the models provided here, feel free to reach out on twitter ([@vykthur](https://twitter.com/vykthur)) and share your work!  ## Motivation - Why Track/Detect hands with Neural Networks?  There are several existing approaches to tracking hands in the computer vision domain. Incidentally, many of these approaches are rule based (e.g extracting background based on texture and boundary features, distinguishing between hands and background using color histograms and HOG classifiers,) making them not very robust. For example, these algorithms might get confused if the background is unusual or in situations where sharp changes in lighting conditions cause sharp changes in skin color or the tracked object becomes occluded.(see [here for a review](https://www.cse.unr.edu/~bebis/handposerev.pdf) paper on hand pose estimation from the HCI perspective)  With sufficiently large datasets, neural networks provide opportunity to train models that perform well and address challenges of existing object tracking/detection algorithms - varied/poor lighting, noisy environments, diverse viewpoints and even occlusion. The main drawbacks to usage for real-time tracking/detection is that they can be complex, are relatively slow compared to tracking-only algorithms and it can be quite expensive to assemble a good dataset. But things are changing with advances in fast neural networks.  Furthermore, this entire area of work has been made more approachable by deep learning frameworks (such as the tensorflow object detection api) that simplify the process of training a model for custom object detection. More importantly, the advent of fast neural network models like ssd, faster r-cnn, rfcn (see [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md#coco-trained-models-coco-models) ) etc make neural networks an attractive candidate for real-time detection (and tracking) applications. Hopefully, this repo demonstrates this.  > If you are not interested in the process of training the detector, you can skip straight to applying the [pretrained model I provide in detecting hands](#detecting-hands).  Training a model is a multi-stage process (assembling dataset, cleaning, splitting into training/test partitions and generating an inference graph). While I lightly touch on the details of these parts, there are a few other tutorials cover training a custom object detector using the tensorflow object detection api in more detail[ see [here](https://pythonprogramming.net/training-custom-objects-tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial/) and [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-train-your-own-object-detector-with-tensorflows-object-detector-api-bec72ecfe1d9) ]. I recommend you walk through those if interested in training a custom object detector from scratch.  ## Data preparation and network training in Tensorflow (Dataset, Import, Training)  **The Egohands Dataset**  The hand detector model is built using data from the [Egohands Dataset](http://vision.soic.indiana.edu/projects/egohands/) dataset. This dataset works well for several reasons. It contains high quality, pixel level annotations (>15000 ground truth labels) where hands are located across 4800 images. All images are captured from an egocentric view (Google glass) across 48 different environments (indoor, outdoor) and activities (playing cards, chess, jenga, solving puzzles etc).  <img src=\"images/egohandstrain.jpg\" width=\"100%\">  If you will be using the Egohands dataset, you can cite them as follows:  > Bambach, Sven, et al. \"Lending a hand: Detecting hands and recognizing activities in complex egocentric interactions.\" Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision. 2015.  The Egohands dataset (zip file with labelled data) contains 48 folders of locations where video data was collected (100 images per folder). ``` -- LOCATION_X   -- frame_1.jpg   -- frame_2.jpg   ...   -- frame_100.jpg   -- polygons.mat  // contains annotations for all 100 images in current folder -- LOCATION_Y   -- frame_1.jpg   -- frame_2.jpg   ...   -- frame_100.jpg   -- polygons.mat  // contains annotations for all 100 images in current folder   ```  **Converting data to Tensorflow Format**  Some initial work needs to be done to the Egohands dataset to transform it into the format (`tfrecord`) which Tensorflow needs to train a model. This repo contains `egohands_dataset_clean.py` a script that will help you generate these csv files.  - Downloads the egohands datasets - Renames all files to include their directory names to ensure each filename is unique - Splits the dataset into train (80%), test (10%) and eval (10%) folders. - Reads in `polygons.mat` for each folder, generates bounding boxes and visualizes them to ensure correctness (see image above). - Once the script is done running, you should have an images folder containing three folders - train, test and eval. Each of these folders should also contain a csv label document each - `train_labels.csv`, `test_labels.csv`  that can be used to generate `tfrecords`  Note: While the egohands dataset provides four separate labels for hands (own left, own right, other left, and other right), for my purpose, I am only interested in the general `hand` class and label all training data as `hand`. You can modify the data prep script to generate `tfrecords` that support 4 labels.  Next: convert your dataset + csv files to tfrecords. A helpful guide on this can be found [here](https://pythonprogramming.net/creating-tfrecord-files-tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial/).For each folder, you should be able to generate  `train.record`, `test.record` required in the training process.   ## Training the hand detection Model  Now that the dataset has been assembled (and your tfrecords), the next task is to train a model based on this. With neural networks, it is possible to use a process called [transfer learning](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/image_retraining) to shorten the amount of time needed to train the entire model. This means we can take an existing model (that has been trained well on a related domain (here image classification) and retrain its final layer(s) to detect hands for us. Sweet!. Given that neural networks sometimes have thousands or millions of parameters that can take weeks or months to train, transfer learning helps shorten training time to possibly hours. Tensorflow does offer a few models (in the tensorflow [model zoo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md#coco-trained-models-coco-models)) and I chose to use the `ssd_mobilenet_v1_coco` model as my start point given it is currently (one of) the fastest models (read the SSD research [paper here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.02325.pdf)). The training process can be done locally on your CPU machine which may take a while or better on a (cloud) GPU machine (which is what I did). For reference, training on my macbook pro (tensorflow compiled from source to take advantage of the mac's cpu architecture) the maximum speed I got was 5 seconds per step as opposed to the ~0.5 seconds per step I got with a GPU. For reference it would take about 12 days to run 200k steps on my mac (i7, 2.5GHz, 16GB) compared to ~5hrs on a GPU.  > **Training on your own images**: Please use the [guide provided by Harrison from pythonprogramming](https://pythonprogramming.net/training-custom-objects-tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial/) on how to generate tfrecords given your label csv files and your images. The guide also covers how to start the training process if training locally. [see [here] (https://pythonprogramming.net/training-custom-objects-tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial/)]. If training in the cloud using a service like GCP, see the [guide here](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/running_on_cloud.md).  As the training process progresses, the expectation is that total loss (errors) gets reduced to its possible minimum (about a value of 1 or thereabout). By observing the tensorboard graphs for total loss(see image below), it should be possible to get an idea of when the training process is complete (total loss does not decrease with further iterations/steps). I ran my training job for 200k steps (took about 5 hours) and stopped at a total Loss (errors) value of 2.575.(In retrospect, I could have stopped the training at about 50k steps and gotten a similar total loss value). With tensorflow, you can also run an evaluation concurrently that assesses your model to see how well it performs on the test data. A commonly used metric for performance is mean average precision (mAP) which is single number used to summarize the area under the precision-recall curve.  mAP is a measure of how well the model generates a bounding box that has at least a 50% overlap with the ground truth bounding box in our test dataset. For the hand detector trained here, the mAP value was **0.9686@0.5IOU**. mAP values range from 0-1, the higher the better.     <img src=\"images/accuracy.jpg\" width=\"100%\">  Once training is completed, the trained inference graph (`frozen_inference_graph.pb`) is then exported (see the earlier referenced guides for how to do this) and saved in the `hand_inference_graph` folder. Now its time to do some interesting detection.  ## Using the Detector to Detect/Track hands   If you have not done this yet, please following the guide on installing [Tensorflow and the Tensorflow object detection api](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/installation.md). This will walk you through setting up the tensorflow framework, cloning the tensorflow github repo and a guide on    - Load the `frozen_inference_graph.pb` trained on the hands dataset as well as the corresponding label map. In this repo, this is done in the `utils/detector_utils.py` script by the `load_inference_graph` method.   ```python   detection_graph = tf.Graph()     with detection_graph.as_default():         od_graph_def = tf.GraphDef()         with tf.gfile.GFile(PATH_TO_CKPT, 'rb') as fid:             serialized_graph = fid.read()             od_graph_def.ParseFromString(serialized_graph)             tf.import_graph_def(od_graph_def, name='')         sess = tf.Session(graph=detection_graph)     print(\">  ====== Hand Inference graph loaded.\")   ``` - Detect hands. In this repo, this is done in the `utils/detector_utils.py` script by the `detect_objects` method.   ```python   (boxes, scores, classes, num) = sess.run(         [detection_boxes, detection_scores,             detection_classes, num_detections],         feed_dict={image_tensor: image_np_expanded})   ``` - Visualize detected bounding detection_boxes. In this repo, this is done in the `utils/detector_utils.py` script by the `draw_box_on_image` method.   This repo contains two scripts that tie all these steps together.  - detect_multi_threaded.py : A threaded implementation for reading camera video input detection and detecting. Takes a set of command line flags to set parameters such as `--display` (visualize detections), image parameters `--width` and `--height`, videe `--source` (0 for camera) etc. - detect_single_threaded.py : Same as above, but single threaded. This script works for video files by setting the video source parameter videe `--source` (path to a video file).   ```cmd   # load and run detection on video at path \"videos/chess.mov\"   python detect_single_threaded.py --source videos/chess.mov ```  > Update: If you do have errors loading the frozen inference graph in this repo, feel free to generate a new graph that fits your TF version from the model-checkpoint in this repo. Use the [export_inference_graph.py](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/export_inference_graph.py) script provided in the tensorflow object detection api repo. More guidance on this [here](https://pythonprogramming.net/testing-custom-object-detector-tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial/?completed=/training-custom-objects-tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial/).  ## Thoughts on Optimization. A few things that led to noticeable performance increases.  - Threading: Turns out that reading images from a webcam is a heavy I/O event and if run on the main application thread can slow down the program. I implemented some good ideas from [Adrian Rosebuck](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/02/06/faster-video-file-fps-with-cv2-videocapture-and-opencv/) on parrallelizing image capture across multiple worker threads. This mostly led to an FPS increase of about 5 points. - For those new to Opencv, images from the `cv2.read()` method return images in [BGR format](https://www.learnopencv.com/why-does-opencv-use-bgr-color-format/). Ensure you convert to RGB before detection (accuracy will be much reduced if you dont). ```python cv2.cvtColor(image_np, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB) ``` - Keeping your input image small will increase fps without any significant accuracy drop.(I used about 320 x 240 compared to the 1280 x 720 which my webcam provides).  - Model Quantization. Moving from the current 32 bit to 8 bit can achieve up to 4x reduction in memory required to load and store models. One way to further speed up this model is to explore the use of [8-bit fixed point quantization](https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/8-bit-quantization-and-tensorflow-lite-speeding-up-mobile-inference-with-low-precision-a882dfcafbbd).  Performance can also be increased by a clever combination of tracking algorithms with the already decent detection and this is something I am still experimenting with. Have ideas for optimizing better, please share!  <img src=\"images/general.jpg\" width=\"100%\"> Note: The detector does reflect some limitations associated with the training set. This includes non-egocentric viewpoints, very noisy backgrounds (e.g in a sea of hands) and sometimes skin tone.  There is opportunity to improve these with additional data.   ## Integrating Multiple DNNs.  One way to make things more interesting is to integrate our new knowledge of where \"hands\" are with other detectors trained to recognize other objects. Unfortunately, while our hand detector can in fact detect hands, it cannot detect other objects (a factor or how it is trained). To create a detector that classifies multiple different objects would mean a long involved process of assembling datasets for each class and a lengthy training process.    > Given the above, a potential strategy is to explore structures that allow us **efficiently** interleave output form multiple pretrained models for various object classes and have them detect multiple objects on a single image.    An example of this is with my primary use case where I am interested in understanding the position of objects on a table with respect to hands on same table. I am currently doing some work on a threaded application that loads multiple detectors and outputs bounding boxes on a single image. More on this soon.",

Anyone can share their apps with other users on {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} but only organizations that are verified by {% data variables.product.company_short %} can sell apps. For more information about organizations, see \"[About organizations](/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/about-organizations).\"  The verification process aims to protect users. For example, it verifies the seller's identity, checks that their {% data variables.product.product_name %} organization is set up securely, and that they can be contacted for support.   After passing the verification checks, any apps that the organization lists on {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} are shown with a verified creator badge {% octicon \"verified\" aria-label=\"Verified creator badge\" %}.

For more information, see \"[Security best practices for apps](/developers/github-marketplace/security-best-practices-for-apps).\"  ### Considerations for free apps  Apps will go through a security review before being listed on {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}. A successful review will meet the requirements and follow the security best practices listed in \"[Security review process](/marketplace/getting-started/security-review-process/).\" For information on the review process, contact [marketplace@github.com](mailto:marketplace@github.com). {% data reusables.marketplace.free-apps-encouraged %}   ### Requirements for paid apps  In addition to the requirements for all apps above, each app that you offer as a paid service on {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} must also meet the following requirements:  - {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %}s should have a minimum of 100 installations. - {% data variables.product.prodname_oauth_app %}s should have a minimum of 200 users. - All paid apps must handle {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} purchase events for new purchases, upgrades, downgrades, cancellations, and free trials.

For information about how integrate these events into your app, see \"[Using the {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} API in your app](/developers/github-marketplace/using-the-github-marketplace-api-in-your-app).\"  To offer your app as a paid service, you'll need to meet these requirements to list your app on {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}: Using GitHub's billing API allows customers to purchase an app without leaving GitHub and to pay for the service with the payment method already attached to their {% data variables.product.product_name %} account.  - To sell your app in {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}, it must use GitHub's billing system.

See \"[Differences between GitHub Apps and OAuth Apps](/apps/differences-between-apps/)\" for more details. - Apps should use the principle of least privilege and should only request the OAuth scopes and GitHub App permissions that the app needs to perform its intended functionality. For more information, see [Principle of least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege) in Wikipedia. - Apps should provide customers with a way to delete their account, without having to email or call a support person. - Apps should not share tokens between different implementations of the app. For example, a desktop app should have a separate token from a web-based app. Individual tokens allow each app to request the access needed for GitHub resources separately. - Design your app with different user roles, depending on the functionality needed by each type of user. For example, a standard user should not have access to admin functionality, and billing managers might not need push access to repository code. - Apps should not share service accounts such as email or database services to manage your SaaS service. - All services used in your app should have unique login and password credentials. - Admin privilege access to the production hosting infrastructure should only be given to engineers and employees with administrative duties. - Apps should not use personal access tokens to authenticate and should authenticate as an [OAuth App](/apps/about-apps/#about-oauth-apps) or a [GitHub App](/apps/about-apps/#about-github-apps):   - OAuth Apps should authenticate using an [OAuth token](/apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps/).   - GitHub Apps should authenticate using either a [JSON Web Token (JWT)](/apps/building-github-apps/authenticating-with-github-apps/#authenticating-as-a-github-app), [OAuth token](/apps/building-github-apps/identifying-and-authorizing-users-for-github-apps/), or [installation access token](/apps/building-github-apps/authenticating-with-github-apps/#authenticating-as-an-installation).  ### Data protection  - Apps should encrypt data transferred over the public internet using HTTPS, with a valid TLS certificate, or SSH for Git. - Apps should store client ID and client secret keys securely. We recommend storing them as [environmental variables](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable#Getting_and_setting_environment_variables). - Apps should delete all GitHub user data within 30 days of receiving a request from the user, or within 30 days of the end of the user's legal relationship with GitHub. - Apps should not require the user to provide their GitHub password. - Apps should encrypt tokens, client IDs, and client secrets.  ### Logging and monitoring  Apps should have logging and monitoring capabilities. App logs should be retained for at least 30 days and archived for at least one year. A security log should include:  - Authentication and authorization events - Service configuration changes - Object reads and writes - All user and group permission changes - Elevation of role to admin - Consistent timestamping for each event - Source users, IP addresses, and/or hostnames for all logged actions  ### Incident response workflow  To provide a secure experience for users, you should have a clear incident response plan in place before listing your app. We recommend having a security and operations incident response team in your company rather than using a third-party vendor. You should have the capability to notify {% data variables.product.product_name %} within 24 hours of a confirmed incident.  For an example of an incident response workflow, see the \"Data Breach Response Policy\" on the [SANS Institute website](https://www.sans.org/information-security-policy/). A short document with clear steps to take in the event of an incident is more valuable than a lengthy policy template.  ### Vulnerability management and patching workflow  You should conduct regular vulnerability scans of production infrastructure. You should triage the results of vulnerability scans and define a period of time in which you agree to remediate the vulnerability.  If you are not ready to set up a full vulnerability management program, it's useful to start by creating a patching process.

Discussions are for conversations that need to be transparent and accessible but do not need to be tracked on a project board and are not related to code, unlike issues. Discussions enable fluid, open conversation in a public forum.  Discussions give a space for more collaborative conversations by connecting and giving a more centralized area to connect and find information.  ### Enabling {% data variables.product.prodname_discussions %} on your repository  Repository owners and people with write access can enable {% data variables.product.prodname_discussions %} for a community on their public repositories.  When you first enable a {% data variables.product.prodname_discussions %}, you will be invited to configure a welcome post.  {% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %} 1.

Click **Start discussion**.   ![\"Start discussion\" button](/assets/images/help/discussions/new-discussion-start-discussion-button.png)  ### Welcoming contributions to your discussions  You can welcome your community and introduce a new way to communicate in a repository by creating a welcome post and pin the post to your {% data variables.product.prodname_discussions %} page. Pinning and locking discussions helps people know that a post is meant as an announcement. You can use announcements as a way to link people to more resources and offer guidance for opening discussions in your community. For more information about pinning a discussion, see \"[Managing discussions in your repository](/discussions/managing-discussions-for-your-community/managing-discussions-in-your-repository#pinning-a-discussion).\"   ### Setting up community guidelines for contributors  You can set contributing guidelines to encourage collaborators to have meaningful, useful conversations that are relevant to the repository. You can also update the repository's README to communicate expectations on when collaborators should open an issue or discussion.  For more information about providing guidelines for your project, see \"[Adding a code of conduct to your project](/github/building-a-strong-community/adding-a-code-of-conduct-to-your-project)\" and \"[Setting up your project for healthy contributions](/github/building-a-strong-community/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions).\"  ### Creating a new discussion  Anyone with access to a repository can create a discussion.  {% data reusables.discussions.starting-a-discussion %}  ### Organizing discussions into relevant categories  Repository owners and people with write access can create new categories to keep discussions organized. Collaborators participating and creating new discussions can group discussions into the most relevant existing categories. Discussions can also be recategorized after they are created. For more information, see \"[Managing categories for discussions in your repository](/discussions/managing-discussions-for-your-community/managing-categories-for-discussions-in-your-repository)\"  ### Promoting healthy conversations  People with write permissions for a repository can help surface important conversations by pinning discussions, deleting discussions that are no longer useful or are damaging to the community, and transferring discussions to more relevant repositories owned by the organization. For more information, see \"[Managing discussions in your repository](/discussions/managing-discussions-for-your-community/managing-discussions-in-your-repository).\"  People with triage permissions for a repository can help moderate a project's discussions by marking comments as answers, locking discussions that are not longer useful or are damaging to the community, and converting issues to discussions when an idea is still in the early stages of development. For more information, see \"[Moderating discussions](/discussions/managing-discussions-for-your-community/moderating-discussions).\"  ### Next steps  Once there is a clear path to scope work out and move an idea from concept to reality, you can create an issue and start tracking your progress.

Each organization can have multiple classrooms.  After you create a classroom, {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %} will prompt you to invite teaching assistants (TAs) and admins to the classroom. Each classroom can have one or more admins. Admins can be teachers, TAs, or any other course administrator who you'd like to have control over your classrooms on {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %}.  Invite TAs and admins to your classroom by inviting the user accounts on {% data variables.product.product_name %} to your organization as organization owners and sharing the URL for your classrom. Organization owners can administer any classroom for the organization. For more information, see \"[Permission levels for an organization](/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/permission-levels-for-an-organization)\" and \"[Inviting users to join your organization](/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/inviting-users-to-join-your-organization).\"  When you're done using a classroom, you can archive the classroom and refer to the classroom, roster, and assignments later, or you can delete the classroom if you no longer need the classroom.  ### About classroom rosters  Each classroom has a roster. A roster is a list of identifiers for the students who participate in your course.  When you first share the URL for an assignment with a student, the student must sign into {% data variables.product.product_name %} with a user account to link the user account to an identifier for the classroom. After the student links a user account, you can see the associated user account in the roster. You can also see when the student accepts or submits an assignment.  ![Classroom roster](/assets/images/help/classroom/roster-hero.png)  ### Prerequisites  You must have an organization account on {% data variables.product.product_name %} to manage classrooms on {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %}.

        "description": "In developmental robotics, robot learning algorithms generate their own sequences of learning experiences, also known as a curriculum, to cumulatively acquire new skills through self-guided exploration and social interaction with humans. These robots use guidance mechanisms such as active learning, maturation, motor synergies and imitation.  Association rules Main article: Association rule learning See also: Inductive logic programming Association rule learning is a rule-based machine learning method for discovering relationships between variables in large databases. It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measure of \"interestingness\".[60]  Rule-based machine learning is a general term for any machine learning method that identifies, learns, or evolves \"rules\" to store, manipulate or apply knowledge. The defining characteristic of a rule-based machine learning algorithm is the identification and utilization of a set of relational rules that collectively represent the knowledge captured by the system. This is in contrast to other machine learning algorithms that commonly identify a singular model that can be universally applied to any instance in order to make a prediction.[61] Rule-based machine learning approaches include learning classifier systems, association rule learning, and artificial immune systems.  Based on the concept of strong rules, Rakesh Agrawal, Tomasz Imieli\u0144ski and Arun Swami introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in large-scale transaction data recorded by point-of-sale (POS) systems in supermarkets.[62] For example, the rule {\\displaystyle \\{\\mathrm {onions,potatoes} \\}\\Rightarrow \\{\\mathrm {burger} \\}}\\{{\\mathrm  {onions,potatoes}}\\}\\Rightarrow \\{{\\mathrm  {burger}}\\} found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together, they are likely to also buy hamburger meat. Such information can be used as the basis for decisions about marketing activities such as promotional pricing or product placements. In addition to market basket analysis, association rules are employed today in application areas including Web usage mining, intrusion detection, continuous production, and bioinformatics. In contrast with sequence mining, association rule learning typically does not consider the order of items either within a transaction or across transactions.  Learning classifier systems (LCS) are a family of rule-based machine learning algorithms that combine a discovery component, typically a genetic algorithm, with a learning component, performing either supervised learning, reinforcement learning, or unsupervised learning. They seek to identify a set of context-dependent rules that collectively store and apply knowledge in a piecewise manner in order to make predictions.[63]  Inductive logic programming (ILP) is an approach to rule-learning using logic programming as a uniform representation for input examples, background knowledge, and hypotheses. Given an encoding of the known background knowledge and a set of examples represented as a logical database of facts, an ILP system will derive a hypothesized logic program that entails all positive and no negative examples. Inductive programming is a related field that considers any kind of programming language for representing hypotheses (and not only logic programming), such as functional programs.  Inductive logic programming is particularly useful in bioinformatics and natural language processing. Gordon Plotkin and Ehud Shapiro laid the initial theoretical foundation for inductive machine learning in a logical setting.[64][65][66] Shapiro built their first implementation (Model Inference System) in 1981: a Prolog program that inductively inferred logic programs from positive and negative examples.[67] The term inductive here refers to philosophical induction, suggesting a theory to explain observed facts, rather than mathematical induction, proving a property for all members of a well-ordered set.  Models Performing machine learning involves creating a model, which is trained on some training data and then can process additional data to make predictions. Various types of models have been used and researched for machine learning systems.  Artificial neural networks Main article: Artificial neural network See also: Deep learning  An artificial neural network is an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of neurons in a brain. Here, each circular node represents an artificial neuron and an arrow represents a connection from the output of one artificial neuron to the input of another. Artificial neural networks (ANNs), or connectionist systems, are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. Such systems \"learn\" to perform tasks by considering examples, generally without being programmed with any task-specific rules.  An ANN is a model based on a collection of connected units or nodes called \"artificial neurons\", which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. Each connection, like the synapses in a biological brain, can transmit information, a \"signal\", from one artificial neuron to another. An artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it. In common ANN implementations, the signal at a connection between artificial neurons is a real number, and the output of each artificial neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs. The connections between artificial neurons are called \"edges\". Artificial neurons and edges typically have a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds. The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection. Artificial neurons may have a threshold such that the signal is only sent if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold. Typically, artificial neurons are aggregated into layers. Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first layer (the input layer) to the last layer (the output layer), possibly after traversing the layers multiple times.  The original goal of the ANN approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would. However, over time, attention moved to performing specific tasks, leading to deviations from biology. Artificial neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks, including computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation, social network filtering, playing board and video games and medical diagnosis.  Deep learning consists of multiple hidden layers in an artificial neural network. This approach tries to model the way the human brain processes light and sound into vision and hearing. Some successful applications of deep learning are computer vision and speech recognition.[68]",

The level of autonomy ranges from fully autonomous (unmanned) vehicles to vehicles where computer-vision-based systems support a driver or a pilot in various situations. Fully autonomous vehicles typically use computer vision for navigation, e.g. for knowing where it is, or for producing a map of its environment (SLAM) and for detecting obstacles. It can also be used for detecting certain task specific events, e.g., a UAV looking for forest fires. Examples of supporting systems are obstacle warning systems in cars, and systems for autonomous landing of aircraft. Several car manufacturers have demonstrated systems for autonomous driving of cars, but this technology has still not reached a level where it can be put on the market. There are ample examples of military autonomous vehicles ranging from advanced missiles to UAVs for recon missions or missile guidance. Space exploration is already being made with autonomous vehicles using computer vision, e.g., NASA's Curiosity and CNSA's Yutu-2 rover.",

It\u2019s important to know that when mentioning machine vision it can be in reference to many different technologies, software and hardware products, integrated systems, actions, methods, and expertise.  Machine vision is a technical capability that is integrated with existing technologies in new ways and applies it with the aim to solve real-world problems.  Machine vision is a systems engineering discipline and can be considered distinct from computer vision which is a form of computer science and not done through a tangible piece of hardware such as a vision box or camera attached to a robot.  Machine vision is the body of a system and computer vision is the intelligence of the system, similar to how a computer is a frame for what goes inside such as the computer chips that power up the computer.  Without computer vision, machine vision can\u2019t work as it\u2019s the brains behind processing the information. It\u2019s important to note that when computer vision technology advances it increases the possibility of potential applications for machine vision increases respectively. ClearView Imaging makes the valid point that computer vision can process images that might not be photos or videos and instead be an image from a thermal or infrared sensor, a motion detector, or other sources.",

To be able to receive proper guidance in this sector, although, still remains expensive for most. Thus, the need arises for an option that could provide base-level diagnosis. The purpose is to better understand the common gestures recognizable by a machine, that are made by humans, in order to realise what they feel.  The article aims to categorically analyse different facial features and how they modify from person to person while they go through a range of emotions. The program focuses on the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to categorise expressions using computer vision to analyse reactions of a human being on a pre- recorded video. There are 7 common emotions included, them being: happy, sad, angry, fear, disgust, surprise and neutrality. Such facial expression recognition programs, when made more complex, will have significant future applications in cybernetics by furthering a more human-like interaction between machines and humans. This could have extended applications for mental healthcare facilities by recognizing emotions indicating common symptoms of depression, stress and anxiety among people.",

        "name": "Overview",
        "description": "Knowledge-representation is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on designing computer representations that capture information about the world that can be used to solve complex problems.  The justification for knowledge representation is that conventional procedural code is not the best formalism to use to solve complex problems. Knowledge representation makes complex software easier to define and maintain than procedural code and can be used in expert systems.  For example, talking to experts in terms of business rules rather than code lessens the semantic gap between users and developers and makes development of complex systems more practical.  Knowledge representation goes hand in hand with automated reasoning because one of the main purposes of explicitly representing knowledge is to be able to reason about that knowledge, to make inferences, assert new knowledge, etc. Virtually all knowledge representation languages have a reasoning or inference engine as part of the system.[10]  A key trade-off in the design of a knowledge representation formalism is that between expressivity and practicality. The ultimate knowledge representation formalism in terms of expressive power and compactness is First Order Logic (FOL). There is no more powerful formalism than that used by mathematicians to define general propositions about the world. However, FOL has two drawbacks as a knowledge representation formalism: ease of use and practicality of implementation. First order logic can be intimidating even for many software developers. Languages that do not have the complete formal power of FOL can still provide close to the same expressive power with a user interface that is more practical for the average developer to understand. The issue of practicality of implementation is that FOL in some ways is too expressive. With FOL it is possible to create statements (e.g. quantification over infinite sets) that would cause a system to never terminate if it attempted to verify them.  Thus, a subset of FOL can be both easier to use and more practical to implement. This was a driving motivation behind rule-based expert systems. IF-THEN rules provide a subset of FOL but a very useful one that is also very intuitive. The history of most of the early AI knowledge representation formalisms; from databases to semantic nets to theorem provers and production systems can be viewed as various design decisions on whether to emphasize expressive power or computability and efficiency.[11]  In a key 1993 paper on the topic, Randall Davis of MIT outlined five distinct roles to analyze a knowledge representation framework:[12]  A knowledge representation (KR) is most fundamentally a surrogate, a substitute for the thing itself, used to enable an entity to determine consequences by thinking rather than acting, i.e., by reasoning about the world rather than taking action in it. It is a set of ontological commitments, i.e., an answer to the question: In what terms should I think about the world? It is a fragmentary theory of intelligent reasoning, expressed in terms of three components: (i) the representation's fundamental conception of intelligent reasoning; (ii) the set of inferences the representation sanctions; and (iii) the set of inferences it recommends. It is a medium for pragmatically efficient computation, i.e., the computational environment in which thinking is accomplished. One contribution to this pragmatic efficiency is supplied by the guidance a representation provides for organizing information so as to facilitate making the recommended inferences. It is a medium of human expression, i.e., a language in which we say things about the world. Knowledge representation and reasoning are a key enabling technology for the Semantic Web. Languages based on the Frame model with automatic classification provide a layer of semantics on top of the existing Internet. Rather than searching via text strings as is typical today, it will be possible to define logical queries and find pages that map to those queries.[13] The automated reasoning component in these systems is an engine known as the classifier. Classifiers focus on the subsumption relations in a knowledge base rather than rules. A classifier can infer new classes and dynamically change the ontology as new information becomes available. This capability is ideal for the ever-changing and evolving information space of the Internet.[14]  The Semantic Web integrates concepts from knowledge representation and reasoning with markup languages based on XML. The Resource Description Framework (RDF) provides the basic capabilities to define knowledge-based objects on the Internet with basic features such as Is-A relations and object properties. The Web Ontology Language (OWL) adds additional semantics and integrates with automatic classification reasoners.[15]",

This can be said without a doubt that apps are the future of our computing world and there is an app for almost everything and anything in the world. The investors are looking for a stable output and something which has a great stability. The Kuwaiti investors are already funding some of the biggest players of app development in the market right now. They are investing one of the up and upcoming market investors and potential business ideas and the one thing common between them and a successful business venture is the ability to work out the market and user statistics with an APP. The biggest of biggest brands have apps. The apps are not only functional in terms of usage and so but provide the business with a huge advantage. They are able to add more and more data which can help with user data logistics and here is the part we play in getting that data logistics and so.  Apptology are able to create user rich experience which can help the business to grow into a newer stage. Here the apps developed are smooth and rich in data which is presented in a suitable manner. The idea for app development is always to make the user experience as smooth and better as possible. They are to be provided with data which can easily be accessed without any whatsoever delay \u2013 This is the motto on which the team of Apptology thrives. The developers present are one of the best in class and are able to develop one of the best user-app experience. The ability to breakdown the business class into multiple easier bits is what makes the apps designed best and better than our competitors.

The Developers of Apptology are very adaptable to different locations and environment. They are able to generate app codes which are not only compact but on precise too. They are also able to deliver projects on time which is very crucial to any app development firm and the business/client catering to it. They are one of the best in Kuwait market and are developers of quick and agile mindset which makes the data interpretation even faster and better.

Like Cherry picking the perfect one, we choose each and every developer carefully and see if she/he is worth the fuss or not.

They can make an application which can be portable and accessible through all major mobile manufacturers and are optimised to run best on any phone provided. Apptology\u2019s Architecture This is very important as the entire guideline of your idea will be enclosed in the app and this can be done by the Architecture present in the App.  Architecture basically stands for the Layout and Design of the app which the users will use. Other than that the seamless integration of user data and making it readily accessible to the users at any given point of time is the work of back-end team which will need a strict code of lines so that the data remains intact whatsoever. This is done when the given layout of the App is in the early stages hence a complete follow through of the process is made available for the company whose app is being developed. We maintain a total transparency over the development so each step by step process can be properly defined with complete guidance. We are an android and iOS application development company in Kuwait. Apptology\u2019s UI/UX which is the basic outlook of your app. The app maybe very smooth and debugged but if the design is very simplistic and the ability to hold the user is deficient then the purpose of app shall become null. The deliverance to the design should be of top class. This allows us to customize the app in a way so that it looks more pleasing to the consumer. Not only that we have to make it more presentable which will allow it to look better than your competition. We are the Best app development company in Kuwait.

Application of these Controller Terms 3.1 Application of Data Protection Legislation These Controller Terms will only apply to the extent that the Data Protection Legislation applies to the processing of Controller Personal Data.  3.2 Application to Data Sharing Setting These Controller Terms will only apply to the Data Sharing Setting for which the parties agreed to these Controller Terms (for example, the Data Sharing Setting for which Customer clicked to accept these Controller Terms).  3.3 Duration These Controller Terms will apply from the Terms Effective Date and continue while Google or Customer processes Controller Personal Data, after which these Controller Terms will automatically terminate.  4. Roles and Restrictions on Processing 4.1 Independent Controllers Subject to Section 4.4 (End Controllers), each:  (a) is an independent controller of Controller Personal Data under the Data Protection Legislation; (b) will individually determine the purposes and means of its processing of Controller Personal Data; and (c) will comply with the obligations applicable to it under the Data Protection Legislation with respect to the processing of Controller Personal Data. 4.2 Restrictions on Processing Section 4.1 (Independent Controllers) will not affect any restrictions on either party\u2019s rights to use or otherwise process Controller Personal Data under the Agreement.  4.3 End User Consent Customer will comply with the Policies in relation to the Controller Personal Data shared pursuant to the Data Sharing Setting and at all times will bear the burden of proof in establishing such compliance.  4.4 End Controllers Without reducing either party\u2019s obligations under these Controller Terms, each party acknowledges that: (a) the other party\u2019s Affiliates or clients may be End Controllers; and (b) the other party may act as a processor on behalf of its End Controllers. The Google End Controllers are: (i) for European Controller Personal Data processed by Google, Google Ireland Limited; and (ii) for UK Controller Personal Data processed by Google, Google LLC. Each party will ensure that its End Controllers comply with the Controller Terms, including (where applicable) the Controller MCCs.  5. Data Transfers 5.1 Data Transfers Subject to Section 5.2, either party may transfer Controller Personal Data to third countries if it complies with the provisions on the transfer of personal data to third countries in the Data Protection Legislation.  5.2 Transfers of UK Controller Personal Data to Google To the extent that Customer transfers UK Controller Personal Data to Google, Customer as data exporter will be deemed to have entered into the Controller MCCs with Google LLC (the applicable Google End Controller) as data importer and the transfers will be subject to the Controller MCCs, because Google LLC is established in the USA and such transfers are therefore to a third country that is not subject to an adequacy decision under the UK GDPR. For clarity, to the extent Customer transfers European Controller Personal Data to Google, the Controller MCCs are not required because Google Ireland Limited (the applicable Google End Controller) is established in Ireland and such transfers are therefore permitted under the Data Protection Legislation.  5.3 Additional Commercial Clauses for the Controller MCCs Sections 5.4 (Contacting Google) to 5.7 (Third Party Controllers) are additional commercial clauses relating to the Controller MCCs as permitted by Clause VII (Variation of these clauses) of the Controller MCCs. Nothing in Sections 5.4 (Contacting Google) to 5.7 (Third Party Controllers) varies or modifies any rights or obligations of the parties to the Controller MCCs.  5.4 Contacting Google Customer may contact Google Ireland Limited and/or Google LLC in connection with the Controller MCCs at https://support.google.com/policies/troubleshooter/9009584 or through such other means as may be provided by Google from time to time, including for the purposes of:  (a) Clause II(e) of the Controller MCCs, to the extent Google LLC acts as data importer and Customer acts as data exporter under the Controller MCCs; and  (b) requesting an Audit pursuant to Section 5.6 (a) (Reviews, Audits and Certifications of Compliance) below.  5.5 Responding to Data Subject Enquiries For the purpose of Clause I(d) of the Controller MCCs, the applicable data importer will be responsible for responding to enquiries from data subjects and the authority concerning the processing of applicable Controller Personal Data by the data importer.  5.6 Reviews, Audits and Certifications of Compliance (a) If the Controller MCCs apply under this Section 5 (Data Transfers), the applicable data importer will allow the applicable data exporter or a third party inspection agent or auditor appointed by the data exporter to conduct a review, audit and/or certification as described in Clause II(g) of the Controller MCCs (\u201cAudit\u201d) in accordance with this Section 5.6 (Reviews, Audits and Certifications of Compliance).  (b) Following receipt by the data importer of a request for an Audit, the data importer and the data exporter will discuss and agree in advance on the reasonable start date, scope and duration of, and security and confidentiality controls applicable to, the Audit.  (c) The data importer may charge a fee (based on the data importer\u2019s reasonable costs) for any Audit. The data importer will provide the data exporter with further details of any applicable fee, and the basis of its calculation, in advance of the Audit. The data exporter will be responsible for any fees charged by any third party inspection agent or auditor appointed by the data exporter to execute the Audit.  (d) The data importer may object to any third party inspection agent or auditor appointed by the data exporter to conduct any Audit if the inspection agent or auditor is, in the data importer\u2019s reasonable opinion, not suitably qualified or independent, a competitor of the data importer or otherwise manifestly unsuitable. Any such objection by the data importer will require the data exporter to appoint another inspection agent or auditor or conduct the Audit itself.  (e) The data importer will not be required either to disclose to the data exporter or its third party inspection agent or auditor, or to allow the data exporter or its third party inspection agent or auditor to access:  (i) any data of any customers of the data importer or any of its Affiliates;  (ii) any internal accounting or financial information of the data importer or any of its Affiliates;  (iii) any trade secret of the data importer or any of its Affiliates;  (iv) any information that, in the data importer\u2019s reasonable opinion, could: (A) compromise the security of any systems or premises of the data importer or any of its Affiliates; or (B) cause the data importer or any Affiliate of the data importer to breach its obligations under the Data Protection Legislation or its security and/or privacy obligations to the data exporter or any third party; or  (v) any information that the data exporter or its third party inspection agent or auditor seeks to access for any reason other than the good faith fullfilment of the data exporter\u2019s obligations under the Data Protection Legislation.  5.7 Third Party Controllers To the extent Google LLC acts as data importer and Customer acts as data exporter under the Controller MCCs under Section 5.2 (Transfers of UK Controller Personal Data to Google), Google notifies Customer for the purpose of Clause II(i) that UK Controller Personal Data may be transferred to the third party data controllers described in applicable Help Centre articles for the Measurement Services.  6. Liability 6.1 Liability Cap If Google is:  (a) party to the Agreement and the Agreement is governed by the laws of: (i) a state of the United States of America, then, notwithstanding anything else in the Agreement, the total liability of either party towards the other party under or in connection with these Controller Terms will be limited to the maximum monetary or payment-based amount at which that party\u2019s liability is capped under the Agreement (for clarity, any exclusion of indemnification claims from the Agreement\u2019s limitation of liability will not apply to indemnification claims under the Agreement relating to the Data Protection Legislation); or (ii) a jurisdiction that is not a state of the United States of America, then the liability of the parties under or in connection with these Controller Terms will be subject to the exclusions and limitations of liability in the Agreement; or (b) not party to the Agreement, to the extent permitted by applicable law, Google will not be liable for Customer\u2019s lost revenues or indirect, special, incidental, consequential, exemplary or punitive damages, even if Google or its Affiliates have been advised of, knew or should have known that such damages do not satisfy a remedy. Google\u2019s (and its Affiliates\u2019) total cumulative liability to Customer or any other party for any loss or damages resulting from claims, damages or actions arising out of or relating to these Controller Terms will not exceed $500 (USD). 6.2 Liability if the Controller MCCs Apply If the Controller MCCs apply under Section 5 (Data Transfers), then: (a) if Google is party to the Agreement, the total combined liability of: (i) Google and Google LLC towards Customer; and (ii) Customer towards Google, Google LLC and Google Ireland Limited; under or in connection with the Agreement and the Controller MCCs combined will be subject to Section 6.1(a) (Liability Cap). Clause III(a) of the Controller MCCs will not affect the previous sentence.  (b) if Google is not party to the Agreement, the total combined liability of: (i) Google and Google LLC towards Customer; and (ii) Customer towards Google, Google LLC and Google Ireland Limited; under or in connection with these Controller Terms and the Controller MCCs combined will be subject to Section 6.1(b) (Liability Cap). Clause III(a) of the Controller MCCs will not affect the previous sentence.  7. Third Party Beneficiaries Where Google LLC is not a party to the Agreement but is a party to the Controller MCCs, Google LLC will be a third-party beneficiary of Sections 4.4 (End Controllers), 5.2 (Transfers of UK Controller Personal Data to Google) to 5.7 (Third Party Controllers), and 6.2 (Liability if the Controller MCCs Apply). To the extent this Section 7 conflicts or is inconsistent with any other clause in the Agreement, this Section 7 will apply.  8.

Subject to the amendments in these Controller Terms, the Agreement between Google and Customer remains in full force and effect.  8.2 Processor Terms These Controller Terms will not replace or affect any Processor Terms. For the avoidance of doubt, if Customer is party to the Processor Terms in connection with the Measurement Services, the Processor Terms will continue to apply to the Measurement Services notwithstanding that these Controller Terms apply to Controller Personal Data processed pursuant to the Data Sharing Setting.  9. Changes to these Controller Terms 9.1 Changes to Controller Terms Google may change these Controller Terms if the change:  (a) is required to comply with applicable law, applicable regulation, a court order or guidance issued by a governmental regulator or agency; or (b) does not: (i) seek to alter the categorisation of the parties as independent controllers of Controller Personal Data under the Data Protection Legislation; (ii) expand the scope of, or remove any restrictions on, either party\u2019s rights to use or otherwise process Controller Personal Data; or (iii) have a material adverse impact on Customer, as reasonably determined by Google. 9.2 Notification of Changes If Google intends to change these Controller Terms under Section 9.1(a) and such change will have a material adverse impact on Customer, as reasonably determined by Google, then Google will use commercially reasonable efforts to inform Customer at least 30 days (or such shorter period as may be required to comply with applicable law, applicable regulation, a court order or guidance issued by a governmental regulator or agency) before the change will take effect. If Customer objects to any such change, Customer may switch off the Data Sharing Setting.  10.

Application of these Controller Terms 3.1 Application of Data Protection Legislation These Controller Terms will only apply to the extent that the Data Protection Legislation applies to the processing of Controller Personal Data.  3.2 Application to Data Sharing Setting These Controller Terms will only apply to the Data Sharing Setting for which the parties agreed to these Controller Terms (for example, the Data Sharing Setting for which Customer clicked to accept these Controller Terms).  3.3 Duration These Controller Terms will apply from the Terms Effective Date and continue while Google or Customer processes Controller Personal Data, after which these Controller Terms will automatically terminate.  4. Roles and Restrictions on Processing 4.1 Independent Controllers Subject to Section 4.4 (End Controllers), each:  (a) is an independent controller of Controller Personal Data under the Data Protection Legislation; (b) will individually determine the purposes and means of its processing of Controller Personal Data; and (c) will comply with the obligations applicable to it under the Data Protection Legislation with respect to the processing of Controller Personal Data. 4.2 Restrictions on Processing Section 4.1 (Independent Controllers) will not affect any restrictions on either party\u2019s rights to use or otherwise process Controller Personal Data under the Agreement.  4.3 End User Consent Customer will comply with the Policies in relation to the Controller Personal Data shared pursuant to the Data Sharing Setting and at all times will bear the burden of proof in establishing such compliance.  4.4 End Controllers Without reducing either party\u2019s obligations under these Controller Terms, each party acknowledges that: (a) the other party\u2019s Affiliates or clients may be End Controllers; and (b) the other party may act as a processor on behalf of its End Controllers. The Google End Controllers are: (i) for European Controller Personal Data processed by Google, Google Ireland Limited; and (ii) for UK Controller Personal Data processed by Google, Google LLC. Each party will ensure that its End Controllers comply with the Controller Terms, including (where applicable) the Controller MCCs.  5. Data Transfers 5.1 Data Transfers Subject to Section 5.2, either party may transfer Controller Personal Data to third countries if it complies with the provisions on the transfer of personal data to third countries in the Data Protection Legislation.  5.2 Transfers of UK Controller Personal Data to Google To the extent that Customer transfers UK Controller Personal Data to Google, Customer as data exporter will be deemed to have entered into the Controller MCCs with Google LLC (the applicable Google End Controller) as data importer and the transfers will be subject to the Controller MCCs, because Google LLC is established in the USA and such transfers are therefore to a third country that is not subject to an adequacy decision under the UK GDPR. For clarity, to the extent Customer transfers European Controller Personal Data to Google, the Controller MCCs are not required because Google Ireland Limited (the applicable Google End Controller) is established in Ireland and such transfers are therefore permitted under the Data Protection Legislation.  5.3 Additional Commercial Clauses for the Controller MCCs Sections 5.4 (Contacting Google) to 5.7 (Third Party Controllers) are additional commercial clauses relating to the Controller MCCs as permitted by Clause VII (Variation of these clauses) of the Controller MCCs. Nothing in Sections 5.4 (Contacting Google) to 5.7 (Third Party Controllers) varies or modifies any rights or obligations of the parties to the Controller MCCs.  5.4 Contacting Google Customer may contact Google Ireland Limited and/or Google LLC in connection with the Controller MCCs at https://support.google.com/policies/troubleshooter/9009584 or through such other means as may be provided by Google from time to time, including for the purposes of:  (a) Clause II(e) of the Controller MCCs, to the extent Google LLC acts as data importer and Customer acts as data exporter under the Controller MCCs; and  (b) requesting an Audit pursuant to Section 5.6 (a) (Reviews, Audits and Certifications of Compliance) below.  5.5 Responding to Data Subject Enquiries For the purpose of Clause I(d) of the Controller MCCs, the applicable data importer will be responsible for responding to enquiries from data subjects and the authority concerning the processing of applicable Controller Personal Data by the data importer.  5.6 Reviews, Audits and Certifications of Compliance (a) If the Controller MCCs apply under this Section 5 (Data Transfers), the applicable data importer will allow the applicable data exporter or a third party inspection agent or auditor appointed by the data exporter to conduct a review, audit and/or certification as described in Clause II(g) of the Controller MCCs (\u201cAudit\u201d) in accordance with this Section 5.6 (Reviews, Audits and Certifications of Compliance).  (b) Following receipt by the data importer of a request for an Audit, the data importer and the data exporter will discuss and agree in advance on the reasonable start date, scope and duration of, and security and confidentiality controls applicable to, the Audit.  (c) The data importer may charge a fee (based on the data importer\u2019s reasonable costs) for any Audit. The data importer will provide the data exporter with further details of any applicable fee, and the basis of its calculation, in advance of the Audit. The data exporter will be responsible for any fees charged by any third party inspection agent or auditor appointed by the data exporter to execute the Audit.  (d) The data importer may object to any third party inspection agent or auditor appointed by the data exporter to conduct any Audit if the inspection agent or auditor is, in the data importer\u2019s reasonable opinion, not suitably qualified or independent, a competitor of the data importer or otherwise manifestly unsuitable. Any such objection by the data importer will require the data exporter to appoint another inspection agent or auditor or conduct the Audit itself.  (e) The data importer will not be required either to disclose to the data exporter or its third party inspection agent or auditor, or to allow the data exporter or its third party inspection agent or auditor to access:  (i) any data of any customers of the data importer or any of its Affiliates;  (ii) any internal accounting or financial information of the data importer or any of its Affiliates;  (iii) any trade secret of the data importer or any of its Affiliates;  (iv) any information that, in the data importer\u2019s reasonable opinion, could: (A) compromise the security of any systems or premises of the data importer or any of its Affiliates; or (B) cause the data importer or any Affiliate of the data importer to breach its obligations under the Data Protection Legislation or its security and/or privacy obligations to the data exporter or any third party; or  (v) any information that the data exporter or its third party inspection agent or auditor seeks to access for any reason other than the good faith fullfilment of the data exporter\u2019s obligations under the Data Protection Legislation.  5.7 Third Party Controllers To the extent Google LLC acts as data importer and Customer acts as data exporter under the Controller MCCs under Section 5.2 (Transfers of UK Controller Personal Data to Google), Google notifies Customer for the purpose of Clause II(i) that UK Controller Personal Data may be transferred to the third party data controllers described in applicable Help Centre articles for the Measurement Services.  6. Liability 6.1 Liability Cap If Google is:  (a) party to the Agreement and the Agreement is governed by the laws of: (i) a state of the United States of America, then, notwithstanding anything else in the Agreement, the total liability of either party towards the other party under or in connection with these Controller Terms will be limited to the maximum monetary or payment-based amount at which that party\u2019s liability is capped under the Agreement (for clarity, any exclusion of indemnification claims from the Agreement\u2019s limitation of liability will not apply to indemnification claims under the Agreement relating to the Data Protection Legislation); or (ii) a jurisdiction that is not a state of the United States of America, then the liability of the parties under or in connection with these Controller Terms will be subject to the exclusions and limitations of liability in the Agreement; or (b) not party to the Agreement, to the extent permitted by applicable law, Google will not be liable for Customer\u2019s lost revenues or indirect, special, incidental, consequential, exemplary or punitive damages, even if Google or its Affiliates have been advised of, knew or should have known that such damages do not satisfy a remedy. Google\u2019s (and its Affiliates\u2019) total cumulative liability to Customer or any other party for any loss or damages resulting from claims, damages or actions arising out of or relating to these Controller Terms will not exceed $500 (USD). 6.2 Liability if the Controller MCCs Apply If the Controller MCCs apply under Section 5 (Data Transfers), then: (a) if Google is party to the Agreement, the total combined liability of: (i) Google and Google LLC towards Customer; and (ii) Customer towards Google, Google LLC and Google Ireland Limited; under or in connection with the Agreement and the Controller MCCs combined will be subject to Section 6.1(a) (Liability Cap). Clause III(a) of the Controller MCCs will not affect the previous sentence.  (b) if Google is not party to the Agreement, the total combined liability of: (i) Google and Google LLC towards Customer; and (ii) Customer towards Google, Google LLC and Google Ireland Limited; under or in connection with these Controller Terms and the Controller MCCs combined will be subject to Section 6.1(b) (Liability Cap). Clause III(a) of the Controller MCCs will not affect the previous sentence.  7. Third Party Beneficiaries Where Google LLC is not a party to the Agreement but is a party to the Controller MCCs, Google LLC will be a third-party beneficiary of Sections 4.4 (End Controllers), 5.2 (Transfers of UK Controller Personal Data to Google) to 5.7 (Third Party Controllers), and 6.2 (Liability if the Controller MCCs Apply). To the extent this Section 7 conflicts or is inconsistent with any other clause in the Agreement, this Section 7 will apply.  8. Priority 8.1 Effect of these Controller Terms If Google is party to the Agreement and there is any conflict or inconsistency between the Controller MCCs, the Additional Terms for Non-European Data Protection Legislation, and the remainder of these Controller Terms and/or the remainder of the Agreement then, subject to Sections 4.2 (Restrictions on Processing) and 8.2 (Processor Terms), the following order of precedence will apply: (a) the Controller MCCs; (b) the Additional Terms for Non-European Data Protection Legislation; (c) the remainder of these Controller Terms; and (d) the remainder of the Agreement. Subject to the amendments in these Controller Terms, the Agreement between Google and Customer remains in full force and effect.  8.2 Processor Terms These Controller Terms will not replace or affect any Processor Terms. For the avoidance of doubt, if Customer is party to the Processor Terms in connection with the Measurement Services, the Processor Terms will continue to apply to the Measurement Services notwithstanding that these Controller Terms apply to Controller Personal Data processed pursuant to the Data Sharing Setting.  9. Changes to these Controller Terms 9.1 Changes to Controller Terms Google may change these Controller Terms if the change:  (a) is required to comply with applicable law, applicable regulation, a court order or guidance issued by a governmental regulator or agency; or (b) does not: (i) seek to alter the categorisation of the parties as independent controllers of Controller Personal Data under the Data Protection Legislation; (ii) expand the scope of, or remove any restrictions on, either party\u2019s rights to use or otherwise process Controller Personal Data; or (iii) have a material adverse impact on Customer, as reasonably determined by Google. 9.2 Notification of Changes If Google intends to change these Controller Terms under Section 9.1(a) and such change will have a material adverse impact on Customer, as reasonably determined by Google, then Google will use commercially reasonable efforts to inform Customer at least 30 days (or such shorter period as may be required to comply with applicable law, applicable regulation, a court order or guidance issued by a governmental regulator or agency) before the change will take effect. If Customer objects to any such change, Customer may switch off the Data Sharing Setting.  10. Additional Provisions 10.1 This Section 10 (Additional Provisions) will only apply where Google is not party to the Agreement.  10.2 Each party will comply with its obligations under these Controller Terms with reasonable skill and care.  10.3 Neither party will use or disclose the other party's Confidential Information without the other's prior written consent except for the purpose of exercising its rights or performing its obligations under these Controller Terms or if required by law, regulation or court order; in which case, the party being compelled to disclose Confidential Information will give the other party as much notice as is reasonably practicable prior to disclosing the Confidential Information.  10.4 To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, except as expressly provided for in these Controller Terms, Google makes no other warranty of any kind whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular use and non-infringement.  10.5 Neither party will be liable for failure or delay in performance to the extent caused by circumstances beyond its reasonable control.  10.6 If any term (or part of a term) of these Controller Terms is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the rest of these Controller Terms will remain in effect.  10.7 (a) Except as set forth in section (b) below, these Controller Terms will be governed by and construed under the laws of the state of California without reference to its conflict of law principles. In the event of any conflicts between foreign law, rules and regulations, and California law, rules and regulations, California law, rules and regulations will prevail and govern. Each party agrees to submit to the exclusive and personal jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act do not apply to these Controller Terms.  (b) Where the Agreement is between Customer and a third party reseller, and the third party reseller is organised in Europe, the Middle East or Africa, these Controller Terms will be governed by English law. Each party agrees to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts in relation to any dispute (whether contractual or non-contractual) arising out of or in connection with these Controller Terms.  (c) In the event the Controller MCCs apply and provide for governing law that differs from the laws outlined in sections (a) and (b) above, the governing law set forth in the Controller MCCs will apply solely with respect to the Controller MCCs.  (d) The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act do not apply to these Controller Terms.  10.8 All notices of termination or breach must be in English, in writing and addressed to the other party\u2019s Legal Department. The address for notices to Google\u2019s Legal Department is legal-notices@google.com. Notice will be treated as given on receipt, as verified by written or automated receipt or by electronic log (as applicable).  10.9 No party will be treated as having waived any rights by not exercising (or delaying the exercise of) any rights under these Controller Terms. No party may assign any part of these Controller Terms without the written consent of the other, except to an Affiliate where: (a) the assignee has agreed in writing to be bound by the terms of these Controller Terms; (b) the assigning party remains liable for obligations under these Controller Terms if the assignee defaults on them; (c) in the case of Customer, the assigning party has transferred its Measurement Services account(s) to the assignee; and (d) the assigning party has notified the other party of the assignment. Any other attempt to assign is void.  10.10 The parties are independent contractors. These Controller Terms do not create any agency, partnership, or joint venture between the parties. These Controller Terms do not confer any benefits on any third party unless they expressly state that they do.  10.11 To the extent permitted by applicable law, these Controller Terms state all terms agreed between the parties. In entering into these Controller Terms no party has relied on, and no party will have any right or remedy based on, any statement, representation or warranty (whether made negligently or innocently), except those expressly stated in these Controller Terms.     Appendix 1: Additional Terms for Non-European Data Protection Legislation The following Additional Terms for Non-European Data Protection Legislation supplement these Controller Terms:  LGPD Controller Addendum to the Google Ads Controller-Controller Data Protection Terms (\u201cLGPD Controller Addendum\u201d) For the purposes of these Controller Terms:  (a) references in the LGPD Controller Addendum to the Google Ads Controller-Controller Data Protection Terms shall be deemed to be references to these Google Measurement Controller-Controller Data Protection Terms; and where Customer has entered into an agreement with a third party reseller for the provision of the Measurement Services then, notwithstanding any contrary provision in the LGPD Controller Addendum, the LGPD Controller Addendum will supplement these Controller Terms that form a separate agreement between Google and Customer and will not affect any agreement between: (i) Google and the third party reseller, or (ii) the third party reseller and Customer.
