        "description": "NOTICE This repository contains the public FTC SDK for the SKYSTONE (2019-2020) competition season. If you are looking for the current season's FTC SDK software, please visit the new and permanent home of the public FTC SDK:  FtcRobotController repository  Welcome! This GitHub repository contains the source code that is used to build an Android app to control a FIRST Tech Challenge competition robot. To use this SDK, download/clone the entire project to your local computer.  Getting Started If you are new to robotics or new to the FIRST Tech Challenge, then you should consider reviewing the FTC Blocks Tutorial to get familiar with how to use the control system:        FTC Blocks Online Tutorial  Even if you are an advanced Java programmer, it is helpful to start with the FTC Blocks tutorial, and then migrate to the OnBot Java Tool or to Android Studio afterwards.  Downloading the Project If you are an Android Studio programmer, there are several ways to download this repo. Note that if you use the Blocks or OnBot Java Tool to program your robot, then you do not need to download this repository.  If you are a git user, you can clone the most current version of the repository:             git clone https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/SKYSTONE.git  Or, if you prefer, you can use the \"Download Zip\" button available through the main repository page. Downloading the project as a .ZIP file will keep the size of the download manageable.  You can also download the project folder (as a .zip or .tar.gz archive file) from the Downloads subsection of the Releases page for this repository.  Once you have downloaded and uncompressed (if needed) your folder, you can use Android Studio to import the folder (\"Import project (Eclipse ADT, Gradle, etc.)\").  Getting Help User Documentation and Tutorials FIRST maintains online documentation with information and tutorials on how to use the FIRST Tech Challenge software and robot control system. You can access this documentation using the following link:        SKYSTONE Online Documentation  Note that the online documentation is an \"evergreen\" document that is constantly being updated and edited. It contains the most current information about the FIRST Tech Challenge software and control system.  Javadoc Reference Material The Javadoc reference documentation for the FTC SDK is now available online. Click on the following link to view the FTC SDK Javadoc documentation as a live website:        FTC Javadoc Documentation  Documentation for the FTC SDK is also included with this repository. There is a subfolder called \"doc\" which contains several subfolders:  The folder \"apk\" contains the .apk files for the FTC Driver Station and FTC Robot Controller apps. The folder \"javadoc\" contains the JavaDoc user documentation for the FTC SDK. Online User Forum For technical questions regarding the Control System or the FTC SDK, please visit the FTC Technology forum:        FTC Technology Forum  Release Information Version 5.5 (20200824-090813) Version 5.5 requires Android Studio 4.0 or later.  New features Adds support for calling custom Java classes from Blocks OpModes (fixes SkyStone issue #161). Classes must be in the org.firstinspires.ftc.teamcode package. Methods must be public static and have no more than 21 parameters. Parameters declared as OpMode, LinearOpMode, Telemetry, and HardwareMap are supported and the argument is provided automatically, regardless of the order of the parameters. On the block, the sockets for those parameters are automatically filled in. Parameters declared as char or java.lang.Character will accept any block that returns text and will only use the first character in the text. Parameters declared as boolean or java.lang.Boolean will accept any block that returns boolean. Parameters declared as byte, java.lang.Byte, short, java.lang.Short, int, java.lang.Integer, long, or java.lang.Long, will accept any block that returns a number and will round that value to the nearest whole number. Parameters declared as float, java.lang.Float, double, java.lang.Double will accept any block that returns a number. Adds telemetry API method for setting display format Classic Monospace HTML (certain tags only) Adds blocks support for switching cameras. Adds Blocks support for TensorFlow Object Detection with a custom model. Adds support for uploading a custom TensorFlow Object Detection model in the Manage page, which is especially useful for Blocks and OnBotJava users. Shows new Control Hub blink codes when the WiFi band is switched using the Control Hub's button (only possible on Control Hub OS 1.1.2) Adds new warnings which can be disabled in the Advanced RC Settings Mismatched app versions warning Unnecessary 2.4 GHz WiFi usage warning REV Hub is running outdated firmware (older than version 1.8.2) Adds support for Sony PS4 gamepad, and reworks how gamepads work on the Driver Station Removes preference which sets gamepad type based on driver position. Replaced with menu which allows specifying type for gamepads with unknown VID and PID Attempts to auto-detect gamepad type based on USB VID and PID If gamepad VID and PID is not known, use type specified by user for that VID and PID If gamepad VID and PID is not known AND the user has not specified a type for that VID and PID, an educated guess is made about how to map the gamepad Driver Station will now attempt to automatically recover from a gamepad disconnecting, and re-assign it to the position it was assigned to when it dropped If only one gamepad is assigned and it drops: it can be recovered If two gamepads are assigned, and have different VID/PID signatures, and only one drops: it will be recovered If two gamepads are assigned, and have different VID/PID signatures, and BOTH drop: both will be recovered If two gamepads are assigned, and have the same VID/PID signatures, and only one drops: it will be recovered If two gamepads are assigned, and have the same VID/PID signatures, and BOTH drop: neither will be recovered, because of the ambiguity of the gamepads when they re-appear on the USB bus. There is currently one known edge case: if there are two gamepads with the same VID/PID signature plugged in, but only one is assigned, and they BOTH drop, it's a 50-50 chance of which one will be chosen for automatic recovery to the assigned position: it is determined by whichever one is re-enumerated first by the USB bus controller. Adds landscape user interface to Driver Station New feature: practice timer with audio cues New feature (Control Hub only): wireless network connection strength indicator (0-5 bars) New feature (Control Hub only): tapping on the ping/channel display will switch to an alternate display showing radio RX dBm and link speed (tap again to switch back) The layout will NOT autorotate. You can switch the layout from the Driver Station's settings menu. Breaking changes Removes support for Android versions 4.4 through 5.1 (KitKat and Lollipop). The minSdkVersion is now 23. Removes the deprecated LinearOpMode methods waitOneFullHardwareCycle() and waitForNextHardwareCycle() Enhancements Handles RS485 address of Control Hub automatically The Control Hub is automatically given a reserved address Existing configuration files will continue to work All addresses in the range of 1-10 are still available for Expansion Hubs The Control Hub light will now normally be solid green, without blinking to indicate the address The Control Hub will not be shown on the Expansion Hub Address Change settings page Improves REV Hub firmware updater The user can now choose between all available firmware update files Version 1.8.2 of the REV Hub firmware is bundled into the Robot Controller app. Text was added to clarify that Expansion Hubs can only be updated via USB. Firmware update speed was reduced to improve reliability Allows REV Hub firmware to be updated directly from the Manage webpage Improves log viewer on Robot Controller Horizontal scrolling support (no longer word wrapped) Supports pinch-to-zoom Uses a monospaced font Error messages are highlighted New color scheme Attempts to force-stop a runaway/stuck OpMode without restarting the entire app Not all types of runaway conditions are stoppable, but if the user code attempts to talk to hardware during the runaway, the system should be able to capture it. Makes various tweaks to the Self Inspect screen Renames \"OS version\" entry to \"Android version\" Renames \"WiFi Direct Name\" to \"WiFi Name\" Adds Control Hub OS version, when viewing the report of a Control Hub Hides the airplane mode entry, when viewing the report of a Control Hub Removes check for ZTE Speed Channel Changer Shows firmware version for all Expansion and Control Hubs Reworks network settings portion of Manage page All network settings are now applied with a single click The WiFi Direct channel of phone-based Robot Controllers can now be changed from the Manage page WiFi channels are filtered by band (2.4 vs 5 GHz) and whether they overlap with other channels The current WiFi channel is pre-selected on phone-based Robot Controllers, and Control Hubs running OS 1.1.2 or later. On Control Hubs running OS 1.1.2 or later, you can choose to have the system automatically select a channel on the 5 GHz band Improves OnBotJava New light and dark themes replace the old themes (chaos, github, chrome,...) the new default theme is light and will be used when you first update to this version OnBotJava now has a tabbed editor Read-only offline mode Improves function of \"exit\" menu item on Robot Controller and Driver Station Now guaranteed to be fully stopped and unloaded from memory Shows a warning message if a LinearOpMode exists prematurely due to failure to monitor for the start condition Improves error message shown when the Driver Station and Robot Controller are incompatible with each other Driver Station OpMode Control Panel now disabled while a Restart Robot is in progress Disables advanced settings related to WiFi direct when the Robot Controller is a Control Hub. Tint phone battery icons on Driver Station when low/critical. Uses names \"Control Hub Portal\" and \"Control Hub\" (when appropriate) in new configuration files Improve I2C read performance Very large improvement on Control Hub; up to ~2x faster with small (e.g. 6 byte) reads Not as apparent on Expansion Hubs connected to a phone Update/refresh build infrastructure Update to 'androidx' support library from 'com.android.support:appcompat', which is end-of-life Update targetSdkVersion and compileSdkVersion to 28 Update Android Studio's Android plugin to latest Fix reported build timestamp in 'About' screen Add sample illustrating manual webcam use: ConceptWebcam Bug fixes Fixes SkyStone issue #248 Fixes SkyStone issue #232 and modifies bulk caching semantics to allow for cache-preserving MANUAL/AUTO transitions. Improves performance when REV 2M distance sensor is unplugged Improves readability of Toast messages on certain devices Allows a Driver Station to connect to a Robot Controller after another has disconnected Improves generation of fake serial numbers for UVC cameras which do not provide a real serial number Previously some devices would assign such cameras a serial of 0:0 and fail to open and start streaming Fixes ftc_app issue #638. Fixes a slew of bugs with the Vuforia camera monitor including: Fixes bug where preview could be displayed with a wonky aspect ratio Fixes bug where preview could be cut off in landscape Fixes bug where preview got totally messed up when rotating phone Fixes bug where crosshair could drift off target when using webcams Fixes issue in UVC driver on some devices (ftc_app 681) if streaming was started/stopped multiple times in a row Issue manifested as kernel panic on devices which do not have this kernel patch. On affected devices which do have the patch, the issue was manifest as simply a failure to start streaming. The Tech Team believes that the root cause of the issue is a bug in the Linux kernel XHCI driver. A workaround was implemented in the SDK UVC driver. Fixes bug in UVC driver where often half the frames from the camera would be dropped (e.g. only 15FPS delivered during a streaming session configured for 30FPS). Fixes issue where TensorFlow Object Detection would show results whose confidence was lower than the minimum confidence parameter. Fixes a potential exploitation issue of CVE-2019-11358 in OnBotJava Fixes changing the address of an Expansion Hub with additional Expansion Hubs connected to it Preserves the Control Hub's network connection when \"Restart Robot\" is selected Fixes issue where device scans would fail while the Robot was restarting Fix RenderScript usage Use androidx.renderscript variant: increased compatibility Use RenderScript in Java mode, not native: simplifies build Fixes webcam-frame-to-bitmap conversion problem: alpha channel wasn't being initialized, only R, G, & B Fixes possible arithmetic overflow in Deadline Fixes deadlock in Vuforia webcam support which could cause 5-second delays when stopping OpMode Version 5.4 (20200108-101156) Fixes SkyStone issue #88 Adds an inspection item that notes when a robot controller (Control Hub) is using the factory default password. Fixes SkyStone issue #61 Fixes SkyStone issue #142 Fixes ftc_app issue #417 by adding more current and voltage monitoring capabilities for REV Hubs. Fixes a crash sometimes caused by OnBotJava activity Improves OnBotJava autosave functionality ftc_app #738 Fixes system responsiveness issue when an Expansion Hub is disconnected Fixes issue where IMU initialization could prevent Op Modes from stopping Fixes issue where AndroidTextToSpeech.speak() would fail if it was called too early Adds telemetry.speak() methods and blocks, which cause the Driver Station (if also updated) to speak text Adds and improves Expansion Hub-related warnings Improves Expansion Hub low battery warning Displays the warning immediately after the hub reports it Specifies whether the condition is current or occurred temporarily during an OpMode run Displays which hubs reported low battery Displays warning when hub loses and regains power during an OpMode run Fixes the hub's LED pattern after this condition Displays warning when Expansion Hub is not responding to commands Specifies whether the condition is current or occurred temporarily during an OpMode run Clarifies warning when Expansion Hub is not present at startup Specifies that this condition requires a Robot Restart before the hub can be used. The hub light will now accurately reflect this state Improves logging and reduces log spam during these conditions Syncs the Control Hub time and timezone to a connected web browser programming the robot, if a Driver Station is not available. Adds bulk read functionality for REV Hubs A bulk caching mode must be set at the Hub level with LynxModule#setBulkCachingMode(). This applies to all relevant SDK hardware classes that reference that Hub. The following following Hub bulk caching modes are available: BulkCachingMode.OFF (default): All hardware calls operate as usual. Bulk data can read through LynxModule#getBulkData() and processed manually. BulkCachingMode.AUTO: Applicable hardware calls are served from a bulk read cache that is cleared/refreshed automatically to ensure identical commands don't hit the same cache. The cache can also be cleared manually with LynxModule#clearBulkCache(), although this is not recommended. (advanced users) BulkCachingMode.MANUAL: Same as BulkCachingMode.AUTO except the cache is never cleared automatically. To avoid getting stale data, the cache must be manually cleared at the beginning of each loop body or as the user deems appropriate. Removes PIDF Annotation values added in Rev 5.3 (to AndyMark, goBILDA and TETRIX motor configurations). The new motor types will still be available but their Default control behavior will revert back to Rev 5.2 Adds new ConceptMotorBulkRead sample Opmode to demonstrate and compare Motor Bulk-Read modes for reducing I/O latencies. Version 5.3 (20191004-112306) Fixes external USB/UVC webcam support Makes various bugfixes and improvements to Blocks page, including but not limited to: Many visual tweaks Browser zoom and window resize behave better Resizing the Java preview pane works better and more consistently across browsers The Java preview pane consistently gets scrollbars when needed The Java preview pane is hidden by default on phones Internet Explorer 11 should work Large dropdown lists display properly on lower res screens Disabled buttons are now visually identifiable as disabled A warning is shown if a user selects a TFOD sample, but their device is not compatible Warning messages in a Blocks op mode are now visible by default. Adds goBILDA 5201 and 5202 motors to Robot Configurator Adds PIDF Annotation values to AndyMark, goBILDA and TETRIX motor configurations. This has the effect of causing the RUN_USING_ENCODERS and RUN_TO_POSITION modes to use PIDF vs PID closed loop control on these motors. This should provide more responsive, yet stable, speed control. PIDF adds Feedforward control to the basic PID control loop. Feedforward is useful when controlling a motor's speed because it \"anticipates\" how much the control voltage must change to achieve a new speed set-point, rather than requiring the integrated error to change sufficiently. The PIDF values were chosen to provide responsive, yet stable, speed control on a lightly loaded motor. The more heavily a motor is loaded (drag or friction), the more noticable the PIDF improvement will be. Fixes startup crash on Android 10 Fixes ftc_app issue #712 (thanks to FROGbots-4634) Fixes ftc_app issue #542 Allows \"A\" and lowercase letters when naming device through RC and DS apps. Version 5.2 (20190905-083277) Fixes extra-wide margins on settings activities, and placement of the new configuration button Adds Skystone Vuforia image target data. Includes sample Skystone Vuforia Navigation op modes (Java). Includes sample Skystone Vuforia Navigation op modes (Blocks). Adds TensorFlow inference model (.tflite) for Skystone game elements. Includes sample Skystone TensorFlow op modes (Java). Includes sample Skystone TensorFlow op modes (Blocks). Removes older (season-specific) sample op modes. Includes 64-bit support (to comply with Google Play requirements). Protects against Stuck OpModes when a Restart Robot is requested. (Thanks to FROGbots-4634) (ftc_app issue #709) Blocks related changes: Fixes bug with blocks generated code when hardware device name is a java or javascript reserved word. Shows generated java code for blocks, even when hardware items are missing from the active configuration. Displays warning icon when outdated Vuforia and TensorFlow blocks are used (SkyStone issue #27) Version 5.1 (20190820-222104) Defines default PIDF parameters for the following motors: REV Core Hex Motor REV 20:1 HD Hex Motor REV 40:1 HD Hex Motor Adds back button when running on a device without a system back button (such as a Control Hub) Allows a REV Control Hub to update the firmware on a REV Expansion Hub via USB Fixes SkyStone issue #9 Fixes ftc_app issue #715 Prevents extra DS User clicks by filtering based on current state. Prevents incorrect DS UI state changes when receiving new OpMode list from RC Adds support for REV Color Sensor V3 Adds a manual-refresh DS Camera Stream for remotely viewing RC camera frames. To show the stream on the DS, initialize but do not run a stream-enabled opmode, select the Camera Stream option in the DS menu, and tap the image to refresh. This feature is automatically enabled when using Vuforia or TFOD\u2014no additional RC configuration is required for typical use cases. To hide the stream, select the same menu item again. Note that gamepads are disabled and the selected opmode cannot be started while the stream is open as a safety precaution. To use custom streams, consult the API docs for CameraStreamServer#setSource and CameraStreamSource. Adds many Star Wars sounds to RobotController resources. Added SKYSTONE Sounds Chooser Sample Program. Switches out startup, connect chimes, and error/warning sounds for Star Wars sounds Updates OnBot Java to use a WebSocket for communication with the robot The OnBot Java page no longer has to do a full refresh when a user switches from editing one file to another Known issues:  Camera Stream The Vuforia camera stream inherits the issues present in the phone preview (namely ftc_app issue #574). This problem does not affect the TFOD camera stream even though it receives frames from Vuforia. The orientation of the stream frames may not always match the phone preview. For now, these frames may be rotated manually via a custom CameraStreamSource if desired. OnBotJava Browser back button may not always work correctly It's possible for a build to be queued, but not started. The OnBot Java build console will display a warning if this occurs. A user might not realize they are editing a different file if the user inadvertently switches from one file to another since this switch is now seamless. The name of the currently open file is displayed in the browser tab. Version 5.0 (built on 19.06.14) Support for the REV Robotics Control Hub. Adds a Java preview pane to the Blocks editor. Adds a new offline export feature to the Blocks editor. Display wifi channel in Network circle on Driver Station. Adds calibration for Logitech C270 Updates build tooling and target SDK. Compliance with Google's permissions infrastructure (Required after build tooling update). Keep Alives to mitigate the Motorola wifi scanning problem. Telemetry substitute no longer necessary. Improves Vuforia error reporting. Fixes ftctechnh/ftc_app issues 621, 713. Miscellaneous bug fixes and improvements. Version 4.3 (built on 18.10.31) Includes missing TensorFlow-related libraries and files. Version 4.2 (built on 18.10.30) Includes fix to avoid deadlock situation with WatchdogMonitor which could result in USB communication errors. Comm error appeared to require that user disconnect USB cable and restart the Robot Controller app to recover. robotControllerLog.txt would have error messages that included the words \"E RobotCore: lynx xmit lock: #### abandoning lock:\" Includes fix to correctly list the parent module address for a REV Robotics Expansion Hub in a configuration (.xml) file. Bug in versions 4.0 and 4.1 would incorrect list the address module for a parent REV Robotics device as \"1\". If the parent module had a higher address value than the daisy-chained module, then this bug would prevent the Robot Controller from communicating with the downstream Expansion Hub. Added requirement for ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION to allow a Driver Station running Android Oreo to scan for Wi-Fi Direct devices. Added google() repo to build.gradle because aapt2 must be downloaded from the google() repository beginning with version 3.2 of the Android Gradle Plugin. Important Note: Android Studio users will need to be connected to the Internet the first time build the ftc_app project. Internet connectivity is required for the first build so the appropriate files can be downloaded from the Google repository. Users should not need to be connected to the Internet for subsequent builds. This should also fix buid issue where Android Studio would complain that it \"Could not find com.android.tools.lint:lint-gradle:26.1.4\" (or similar). Added support for REV Spark Mini motor controller as part of the configuration menu for a servo/PWM port on the REV Expansion Hub. Provide examples for playing audio files in an Op Mode. Block Development Tool Changes Includes a fix for a problem with the Velocity blocks that were reported in the FTC Technology forum (Blocks Programming subforum). Change the \"Save completed successfully.\" message to a white color so it will contrast with a green background. Fixed the \"Download image\" feature so it will work if there are text blocks in the op mode. Introduce support for Google's TensorFlow Lite technology for object detetion for 2018-2019 game. TensorFlow lite can recognize Gold Mineral and Silver Mineral from 2018-2019 game. Example Java and Block op modes are included to show how to determine the relative position of the gold block (left, center, right). Version 4.1 (released on 18.09.24) Changes include:  Fix to prevent crash when deprecated configuration annotations are used. Change to allow FTC Robot Controller APK to be auto-updated using FIRST Global Control Hub update scripts. Removed samples for non supported / non legal hardware. Improvements to Telemetry.addData block with \"text\" socket. Updated Blocks sample op mode list to include Rover Ruckus Vuforia example. Update SDK library version number. Version 4.0 (released on 18.09.12) Changes include:  Initial support for UVC compatible cameras  If UVC camera has a unique serial number, RC will detect and enumerate by serial number. If UVC camera lacks a unique serial number, RC will only support one camera of that type connected. Calibration settings for a few cameras are included (see TeamCode/src/main/res/xml/teamwebcamcalibrations.xml for details). User can upload calibration files from Program and Manage web interface. UVC cameras seem to draw a fair amount of electrical current from the USB bus. This does not appear to present any problems for the REV Robotics Control Hub. This does seem to create stability problems when using some cameras with an Android phone-based Robot Controller. FTC Tech Team is investigating options to mitigate this issue with the phone-based Robot Controllers. Updated sample Vuforia Navigation and VuMark Op Modes to demonstrate how to use an internal phone-based camera and an external UVC webcam. Support for improved motor control.  REV Robotics Expansion Hub firmware 1.8 and greater will support a feed forward mechanism for closed loop motor control. FTC SDK has been modified to support PIDF coefficients (proportional, integral, derivative, and feed forward). FTC Blocks development tool modified to include PIDF programming blocks. Deprecated older PID-related methods and variables. REV's 1.8.x PIDF-related changes provide a more linear and accurate way to control a motor. Wireless  Added 5GHz support for wireless channel changing for those devices that support it. Tested with Moto G5 and E4 phones. Also tested with other (currently non-approved) phones such as Samsung Galaxy S8. Improved Expansion Hub firmware update support in Robot Controller app  Changes to make the system more robust during the firmware update process (when performed through Robot Controller app). User no longer has to disconnect a downstream daisy-chained Expansion Hub when updating an Expansion Hub's firmware. If user is updating an Expansion Hub's firmware through a USB connection, he/she does not have to disconnect RS485 connection to other Expansion Hubs. The user still must use a USB connection to update an Expansion Hub's firmware. The user cannot update the Expansion Hub firmware for a downstream device that is daisy chained through an RS485 connection. If an Expansion Hub accidentally gets \"bricked\" the Robot Controller app is now more likely to recognize the Hub when it scans the USB bus. Robot Controller app should be able to detect an Expansion Hub, even if it accidentally was bricked in a previous update attempt. Robot Controller app should be able to install the firmware onto the Hub, even if if accidentally was bricked in a previous update attempt. Resiliency  FTC software can detect and enable an FTDI reset feature that is available with REV Robotics v1.8 Expansion Hub firmware and greater. When enabled, the Expansion Hub can detect if it hasn't communicated with the Robot Controller over the FTDI (USB) connection. If the Hub hasn't heard from the Robot Controller in a while, it will reset the FTDI connection. This action helps system recover from some ESD-induced disruptions. Various fixes to improve reliability of FTC software. Blocks  Fixed errors with string and list indices in blocks export to java. Support for USB connected UVC webcams. Refactored optimized Blocks Vuforia code to support Rover Ruckus image targets. Added programming blocks to support PIDF (proportional, integral, derivative and feed forward) motor control. Added formatting options (under Telemetry and Miscellaneous categories) so user can set how many decimal places to display a numerical value. Support to play audio files (which are uploaded through Blocks web interface) on Driver Station in addition to the Robot Controller. Fixed bug with Download Image of Blocks feature. Support for REV Robotics Blinkin LED Controller. Support for REV Robotics 2m Distance Sensor. Added support for a REV Touch Sensor (no longer have to configure as a generic digital device). Added blocks for DcMotorEx methods. These are enhanced methods that you can use when supported by the motor controller hardware. The REV Robotics Expansion Hub supports these enhanced methods. Enhanced methods include methods to get/set motor velocity (in encoder pulses per second), get/set PIDF coefficients, etc.. Modest Improvements in Logging  Decrease frequency of battery checker voltage statements. Removed non-FTC related log statements (wherever possible). Introduced a \"Match Logging\" feature. Under \"Settings\" a user can enable/disable this feature (it's disabled by default). If enabled, user provides a \"Match Number\" through the Driver Station user interface (top of the screen). The Match Number is used to create a log file specifically with log statements from that particular Op Mode run. Match log files are stored in /sdcard/FIRST/matlogs on the Robot Controller. Once an op mode run is complete, the Match Number is cleared. This is a convenient way to create a separate match log with statements only related to a specific op mode run. New Devices  Support for REV Robotics Blinkin LED Controller. Support for REV Robotics 2m Distance Sensor. Added configuration option for REV 20:1 HD Hex Motor. Added support for a REV Touch Sensor (no longer have to configure as a generic digital device). Miscellaneous  Fixed some errors in the definitions for acceleration and velocity in our javadoc documentation. Added ability to play audio files on Driver Station When user is configuring an Expansion Hub, the LED on the Expansion Hub will change blink pattern (purple-cyan) to indicate which Hub is currently being configured. Renamed I2cSensorType to I2cDeviceType. Added an external sample Op Mode that demonstrates localization using 2018-2019 (Rover Ruckus presented by QualComm) Vuforia targets. Added an external sample Op Mode that demonstrates how to use the REV Robotics 2m Laser Distance Sensor. Added an external sample Op Mode that demonstrates how to use the REV Robotics Blinkin LED Controller. Re-categorized external Java sample Op Modes to \"TeleOp\" instead of \"Autonomous\". Known issues:  Initial support for UVC compatible cameras  UVC cameras seem to draw significant amount of current from the USB bus. This does not appear to present any problems for the REV Robotics Control Hub. This does seem to create stability problems when using some cameras with an Android phone-based Robot Controller. FTC Tech Team is investigating options to mitigate this issue with the phone-based Robot Controllers. There might be a possible deadlock which causes the RC to become unresponsive when using a UVC webcam with a Nougat Android Robot Controller. Wireless  When user selects a wireless channel, this channel does not necessarily persist if the phone is power cycled. Tech Team is hoping to eventually address this issue in a future release. Issue has been present since apps were introduced (i.e., it is not new with the v4.0 release). Wireless channel is not currently displayed for WiFi Direct connections. Miscellaneous  The blink indication feature that shows which Expansion Hub is currently being configured does not work for a newly created configuration file. User has to first save a newly created configuration file and then close and re-edit the file in order for blink indicator to work. Version 3.6 (built on 17.12.18) Changes include:  Blocks Changes Uses updated Google Blockly software to allow users to edit their op modes on Apple iOS devices (including iPad and iPhone). Improvement in Blocks tool to handle corrupt op mode files. Autonomous op modes should no longer get switched back to tele-op after re-opening them to be edited. The system can now detect type mismatches during runtime and alert the user with a message on the Driver Station. Updated javadoc documentation for setPower() method to reflect correct range of values (-1 to +1). Modified VuforiaLocalizerImpl to allow for user rendering of frames Added a user-overrideable onRenderFrame() method which gets called by the class's renderFrame() method. Version 3.5 (built on 17.10.30) Changes with version 3.5 include:  Introduced a fix to prevent random op mode stops, which can occur after the Robot Controller app has been paused and then resumed (for example, when a user temporarily turns off the display of the Robot Controller phone, and then turns the screen back on). Introduced a fix to prevent random op mode stops, which were previously caused by random peer disconnect events on the Driver Station. Fixes issue where log files would be closed on pause of the RC or DS, but not re-opened upon resume. Fixes issue with battery handler (voltage) start/stop race. Fixes issue where Android Studio generated op modes would disappear from available list in certain situations. Fixes problem where OnBot Java would not build on REV Robotics Control Hub. Fixes problem where OnBot Java would not build if the date and time on the Robot Controller device was \"rewound\" (set to an earlier date/time). Improved error message on OnBot Java that occurs when renaming a file fails. Removed unneeded resources from android.jar binaries used by OnBot Java to reduce final size of Robot Controller app. Added MR_ANALOG_TOUCH_SENSOR block to Blocks Programming Tool. Version 3.4 (built on 17.09.06) Changes with version 3.4 include:  Added telemetry.update() statement for BlankLinearOpMode template. Renamed sample Block op modes to be more consistent with Java samples. Added some additional sample Block op modes. Reworded OnBot Java readme slightly. Version 3.3 (built on 17.09.04) This version of the software includes improves for the FTC Blocks Programming Tool and the OnBot Java Programming Tool.  Changes with verion 3.3 include:  Android Studio ftc_app project has been updated to use Gradle Plugin 2.3.3. Android Studio ftc_app project is already using gradle 3.5 distribution. Robot Controller log has been renamed to /sdcard/RobotControllerLog.txt (note that this change was actually introduced w/ v3.2). Improvements in I2C reliability. Optimized I2C read for REV Expansion Hub, with v1.7 firmware or greater. Updated all external/samples (available through OnBot and in Android project folder). Vuforia Added support for VuMarks that will be used for the 2017-2018 season game. Blocks Update to latest Google Blockly release. Sample op modes can be selected as a template when creating new op mode. Fixed bug where the blocks would disappear temporarily when mouse button is held down. Added blocks for Range.clip and Range.scale. User can now disable/enable Block op modes. Fix to prevent occasional Blocks deadlock. OnBot Java Significant improvements with autocomplete function for OnBot Java editor. Sample op modes can be selected as a template when creating new op mode. Fixes and changes to complete hardware setup feature. Updated (and more useful) onBot welcome message. Known issues:  Android Studio After updating to the new v3.3 Android Studio project folder, if you get error messages indicating \"InvalidVirtualFileAccessException\" then you might need to do a File->Invalidate Caches / Restart to clear the error. OnBot Java Sometimes when you push the build button to build all op modes, the RC returns an error message that the build failed. If you press the build button a second time, the build typically suceeds. Version 3.2 (built on 17.08.02) This version of the software introduces the \"OnBot Java\" Development Tool. Similar to the FTC Blocks Development Tool, the FTC OnBot Java Development Tool allows a user to create, edit and build op modes dynamically using only a Javascript-enabled web browser.  The OnBot Java Development Tool is an integrated development environment (IDE) that is served up by the Robot Controller. Op modes are created and edited using a Javascript-enabled browser (Google Chromse is recommended). Op modes are saved on the Robot Controller Android device directly.  The OnBot Java Development Tool provides a Java programming environment that does NOT need Android Studio.  Changes with version 3.2 include:  Enhanced web-based development tools  Introduction of OnBot Java Development Tool. Web-based programming and management features are \"always on\" (user no longer needs to put Robot Controller into programming mode). Web-based management interface (where user can change Robot Controller name and also easily download Robot Controller log file). OnBot Java, Blocks and Management features available from web based interface. Blocks Programming Development Tool:  Changed \"LynxI2cColorRangeSensor\" block to \"REV Color/range sensor\" block. Fixed tooltip for ColorSensor.isLightOn block. Added blocks for ColorSensor.getNormalizedColors and LynxI2cColorRangeSensor.getNormalizedColors. Added example op modes for digital touch sensor and REV Robotics Color Distance sensor.  User selectable color themes.  Includes many minor enhancements and fixes (too numerous to list).  Known issues:  Auto complete function is incomplete and does not support the following (for now): Access via this keyword Access via super keyword Members of the super cloass, not overridden by the class Any methods provided in the current class Inner classes Can't handle casted objects Any objects coming from an parenthetically enclosed expression Version 3.10 (built on 17.05.09) This version of the software provides support for the REV Robotics Expansion Hub. This version also includes improvements in the USB communication layer in an effort to enhance system resiliency. If you were using a 2.x version of the software previously, updating to version 3.1 requires that you also update your Driver Station software in addition to updating the Robot Controller software.  Also note that in version 3.10 software, the setMaxSpeed and getMaxSpeed methods are no longer available (not deprecated, they have been removed from the SDK). Also note that the the new 3.x software incorporates motor profiles that a user can select as he/she configures the robot.  Changes include:  Blocks changes Added VuforiaTrackableDefaultListener.getPose and Vuforia.trackPose blocks. Added optimized blocks support for Vuforia extended tracking. Added atan2 block to the math category. Added useCompetitionFieldTargetLocations parameter to Vuforia.initialize block. If set to false, the target locations are placed at (0,0,0) with target orientation as specified in https://github.com/gearsincorg/FTCVuforiaDemo/blob/master/Robot_Navigation.java tutorial op mode. Incorporates additional improvements to USB comm layer to improve system resiliency (to recover from a greater number of communication disruptions). Additional Notes Regarding Version 3.00 (built on 17.04.13)  In addition to the release changes listed below (see section labeled \"Version 3.00 (built on 17.04.013)\"), version 3.00 has the following important changes:  Version 3.00 software uses a new version of the FTC Robocol (robot protocol). If you upgrade to v3.0 on the Robot Controller and/or Android Studio side, you must also upgrade the Driver Station software to match the new Robocol. Version 3.00 software removes the setMaxSpeed and getMaxSpeed methods from the DcMotor class. If you have an op mode that formerly used these methods, you will need to remove the references/calls to these methods. Instead, v3.0 provides the max speed information through the use of motor profiles that are selected by the user during robot configuration. Version 3.00 software currently does not have a mechanism to disable extra i2c sensors. We hope to re-introduce this function with a release in the near future. Version 3.00 (built on 17.04.13) *** Use this version of the software at YOUR OWN RISK!!! ***  This software is being released as an \"alpha\" version. Use this version at your own risk!  This pre-release software contains SIGNIFICANT changes, including changes to the Wi-Fi Direct pairing mechanism, rewrites of the I2C sensor classes, changes to the USB/FTDI layer, and the introduction of support for the REV Robotics Expansion Hub and the REV Robotics color-range-light sensor. These changes were implemented to improve the reliability and resiliency of the FTC control system.  Please note, however, that version 3.00 is considered \"alpha\" code. This code is being released so that the FIRST community will have an opportunity to test the new REV Expansion Hub electronics module when it becomes available in May. The developers do not recommend using this code for critical applications (i.e., competition use).  *** Use this version of the software at YOUR OWN RISK!!! ***  Changes include:  Major rework of sensor-related infrastructure. Includes rewriting sensor classes to implement synchronous I2C communication. Fix to reset Autonomous timer back to 30 seconds. Implementation of specific motor profiles for approved 12V motors (includes Tetrix, AndyMark, Matrix and REV models). Modest improvements to enhance Wi-Fi P2P pairing. Fixes telemetry log addition race. Publishes all the sources (not just a select few). Includes Block programming improvements Addition of optimized Vuforia blocks. Auto scrollbar to projects and sounds pages. Fixed blocks paste bug. Blocks execute after while-opModeIsActive loop (to allow for cleanup before exiting op mode). Added gyro integratedZValue block. Fixes bug with projects page for Firefox browser. Added IsSpeaking block to AndroidTextToSpeech. Implements support for the REV Robotics Expansion Hub Implements support for integral REV IMU (physically installed on I2C bus 0, uses same Bosch BNO055 9 axis absolute orientation sensor as Adafruit 9DOF abs orientation sensor). - Implements support for REV color/range/light sensor. Provides support to update Expansion Hub firmware through FTC SDK. Detects REV firmware version and records in log file. Includes support for REV Control Hub (note that the REV Control Hub is not yet approved for FTC use). Implements FTC Blocks programming support for REV Expansion Hub and sensor hardware. Detects and alerts when I2C device disconnect. Version 2.62 (built on 17.01.07) Added null pointer check before calling modeToByte() in finishModeSwitchIfNecessary method for ModernRoboticsUsbDcMotorController class. Changes to enhance Modern Robotics USB protocol robustness. Version 2.61 (released on 16.12.19) Blocks Programming mode changes: Fix to correct issue when an exception was thrown because an OpticalDistanceSensor object appears twice in the hardware map (the second time as a LightSensor). Version 2.6 (released on 16.12.16) Fixes for Gyro class: Improve (decrease) sensor refresh latency. fix isCalibrating issues. Blocks Programming mode changes: Blocks now ignores a device in the configuration xml if the name is empty. Other devices work in configuration work fine. Version 2.5 (internal release on released on 16.12.13) Blocks Programming mode changes: Added blocks support for AdafruitBNO055IMU. Added Download Op Mode button to FtcBocks.html. Added support for copying blocks in one OpMode and pasting them in an other OpMode. The clipboard content is stored on the phone, so the programming mode server must be running. Modified Utilities section of the toolbox. In Programming Mode, display information about the active connections. Fixed paste location when workspace has been scrolled. Added blocks support for the android Accelerometer. Fixed issue where Blocks Upload Op Mode truncated name at first dot. Added blocks support for Android SoundPool.

Added type safety to blocks for Quaternion. Added type safety to blocks for Servo. Added type safety to blocks for ServoController. Added type safety to blocks for Telemetry. Added type safety to blocks for Temperature. Added type safety to blocks for TouchSensor. Added type safety to blocks for UltrasonicSensor. Added type safety to blocks for VectorF. Added type safety to blocks for Velocity. Added type safety to blocks for VoltageSensor. Added type safety to blocks for VuforiaLocalizer.Parameters. Added type safety to blocks for VuforiaTrackable. Added type safety to blocks for VuforiaTrackables. Added type safety to blocks for enums in AdafruitBNO055IMU.Parameters. Added type safety to blocks for AndroidAccelerometer, AndroidGyroscope, AndroidOrientation, and AndroidTextToSpeech. Version 2.4 (released on 16.11.13) Fix to avoid crashing for nonexistent resources. Blocks Programming mode changes: Added blocks to support OpenGLMatrix, MatrixF, and VectorF. Added blocks to support AngleUnit, AxesOrder, AxesReference, CameraDirection, CameraMonitorFeedback, DistanceUnit, and TempUnit. Added blocks to support Acceleration.

Provides ability to disable audio cues. various bug fixes and improvements. Version 2.00 (released on 16.08.19) This is the new release for the upcoming 2016-2017 FIRST Tech Challenge Season. Channel change is enabled in the FTC Robot Controller app for Moto G 2nd and 3rd Gen phones. Users can now use annotations to register/disable their Op Modes. Changes in the Android SDK, JDK and build tool requirements (minsdk=19, java 1.7, build tools 23.0.3). Standardized units in analog input. Cleaned up code for existing analog sensor classes. setChannelMode and getChannelMode were REMOVED from the DcMotorController class. This is important - we no longer set the motor modes through the motor controller. setMode and getMode were added to the DcMotor class. ContinuousRotationServo class has been added to the FTC SDK. Range.clip() method has been overloaded so it can support this operation for int, short and byte integers. Some changes have been made (new methods added) on how a user can access items from the hardware map. Users can now set the zero power behavior for a DC motor so that the motor will brake or float when power is zero. Prototype Blockly Programming Mode has been added to FTC Robot Controller. Users can place the Robot Controller into this mode, and then use a device (such as a laptop) that has a Javascript enabled browser to write Blockly-based Op Modes directly onto the Robot Controller. Users can now configure the robot remotely through the FTC Driver Station app. Android Studio project supports Android Studio 2.1.x and compile SDK Version 23 (Marshmallow). Vuforia Computer Vision SDK integrated into FTC SDK. Users can use sample vision targets to get localization information on a standard FTC field. Project structure has been reorganized so that there is now a TeamCode package that users can use to place their local/custom Op Modes into this package. Inspection function has been integrated into the FTC Robot Controller and Driver Station Apps (Thanks Team HazMat\u2026 9277 & 10650!). Audio cues have been incorporated into FTC SDK. Swap mechanism added to FTC Robot Controller configuration activity. For example, if you have two motor controllers on a robot, and you misidentified them in your configuration file, you can use the Swap button to swap the devices within the configuration file (so you do not have to manually re-enter in the configuration info for the two devices). Fix mechanism added to all user to replace an electronic module easily. For example, suppose a servo controller dies on your robot. You replace the broken module with a new module, which has a different serial number from the original servo controller. You can use the Fix button to automatically reconfigure your configuration file to use the serial number of the new module. Improvements made to fix resiliency and responsiveness of the system. For LinearOpMode the user now must for a telemetry.update() to update the telemetry data on the driver station. This update() mechanism ensures that the driver station gets the updated data properly and at the same time. The Auto Configure function of the Robot Controller is now template based. If there is a commonly used robot configuration, a template can be created so that the Auto Configure mechanism can be used to quickly configure a robot of this type. The logic to detect a runaway op mode (both in the LinearOpMode and OpMode types) and to abort the run, then auto recover has been improved/implemented. Fix has been incorporated so that Logitech F310 gamepad mappings will be correct for Marshmallow users. Release 16.07.08 For the ftc_app project, the gradle files have been modified to support Android Studio 2.1.x. Release 16.03.30 For the MIT App Inventor, the design blocks have new icons that better represent the function of each design component. Some changes were made to the shutdown logic to ensure the robust shutdown of some of our USB services. A change was made to LinearOpMode so as to allow a given instance to be executed more than once, which is required for the App Inventor. Javadoc improved/updated. Release 16.03.09 Changes made to make the FTC SDK synchronous (significant change!) waitOneFullHardwareCycle() and waitForNextHardwareCycle() are no longer needed and have been deprecated. runOpMode() (for a LinearOpMode) is now decoupled from the system's hardware read/write thread. loop() (for an OpMode) is now decoupled from the system's hardware read/write thread. Methods are synchronous. For example, if you call setMode(DcMotorController.RunMode.RESET_ENCODERS) for a motor, the encoder is guaranteed to be reset when the method call is complete. For legacy module (NXT compatible), user no longer has to toggle between read and write modes when reading from or writing to a legacy device. Changes made to enhance reliability/robustness during ESD event. Changes made to make code thread safe. Debug keystore added so that user-generated robot controller APKs will all use the same signed key (to avoid conflicts if a team has multiple developer laptops for example). Firmware version information for Modern Robotics modules are now logged. Changes made to improve USB comm reliability and robustness. Added support for voltage indicator for legacy (NXT-compatible) motor controllers. Changes made to provide auto stop capabilities for op modes. A LinearOpMode class will stop when the statements in runOpMode() are complete. User does not have to push the stop button on the driver station. If an op mode is stopped by the driver station, but there is a run away/uninterruptible thread persisting, the app will log an error message then force itself to crash to stop the runaway thread. Driver Station UI modified to display lowest measured voltage below current voltage (12V battery). Driver Station UI modified to have color background for current voltage (green=good, yellow=caution, red=danger, extremely low voltage). javadoc improved (edits and additional classes). Added app build time to About activity for driver station and robot controller apps. Display local IP addresses on Driver Station About activity. Added I2cDeviceSynchImpl. Added I2cDeviceSync interface. Added seconds() and milliseconds() to ElapsedTime for clarity. Added getCallbackCount() to I2cDevice. Added missing clearI2cPortActionFlag. Added code to create log messages while waiting for LinearOpMode shutdown. Fix so Wifi Direct Config activity will no longer launch multiple times. Added the ability to specify an alternate i2c address in software for the Modern Robotics gyro. Release 16.02.09 Improved battery checker feature so that voltage values get refreshed regularly (every 250 msec) on Driver Station (DS) user interface. Improved software so that Robot Controller (RC) is much more resilient and \u201cself-healing\u201d to USB disconnects: If user attempts to start/restart RC with one or more module missing, it will display a warning but still start up. When running an op mode, if one or more modules gets disconnected, the RC & DS will display warnings,and robot will keep on working in spite of the missing module(s). If a disconnected module gets physically reconnected the RC will auto detect the module and the user will regain control of the recently connected module. Warning messages are more helpful (identifies the type of module that\u2019s missing plus its USB serial number). Code changes to fix the null gamepad reference when users try to reference the gamepads in the init() portion of their op mode. NXT light sensor output is now properly scaled. Note that teams might have to readjust their light threshold values in their op modes. On DS user interface, gamepad icon for a driver will disappear if the matching gamepad is disconnected or if that gamepad gets designated as a different driver. Robot Protocol (ROBOCOL) version number info is displayed in About screen on RC and DS apps. Incorporated a display filter on pairing screen to filter out devices that don\u2019t use the \u201c-\u201c format. This filter can be turned off to show all WiFi Direct devices. Updated text in License file. Fixed formatting error in OpticalDistanceSensor.toString(). Fixed issue on with a blank (\u201c\u201d) device name that would disrupt WiFi Direct Pairing. Made a change so that the WiFi info and battery info can be displayed more quickly on the DS upon connecting to RC. Improved javadoc generation. Modified code to make it easier to support language localization in the future. Release 16.01.04 Updated compileSdkVersion for apps Prevent Wifi from entering power saving mode removed unused import from driver station Corrrected \"Dead zone\" joystick code. LED.getDeviceName and .getConnectionInfo() return null apps check for ROBOCOL_VERSION mismatch Fix for Telemetry also has off-by-one errors in its data string sizing / short size limitations error User telemetry output is sorted. added formatting variants to DbgLog and RobotLog APIs code modified to allow for a long list of op mode names. changes to improve thread safety of RobocolDatagramSocket Fix for \"missing hardware leaves robot controller disconnected from driver station\" error fix for \"fast tapping of Init/Start causes problems\" (toast is now only instantiated on UI thread). added some log statements for thread life cycle. moved gamepad reset logic inside of initActiveOpMode() for robustness changes made to mitigate risk of race conditions on public methods. changes to try and flag when WiFi Direct name contains non-printable characters. fix to correct race condition between .run() and .close() in ReadWriteRunnableStandard. updated FTDI driver made ReadWriteRunnableStanard interface public. fixed off-by-one errors in Command constructor moved specific hardware implmentations into their own package. moved specific gamepad implemnatations to the hardware library. changed LICENSE file to new BSD version. fixed race condition when shutting down Modern Robotics USB devices. methods in the ColorSensor classes have been synchronized. corrected isBusy() status to reflect end of motion. corrected \"back\" button keycode. the notSupported() method of the GyroSensor class was changed to protected (it should not be public). Release 15.11.04.001 Added Support for Modern Robotics Gyro. The GyroSensor class now supports the MR Gyro Sensor. Users can access heading data (about Z axis) Users can also access raw gyro data (X, Y, & Z axes). Example MRGyroTest.java op mode included. Improved error messages More descriptive error messages for exceptions in user code. Updated DcMotor API Enable read mode on new address in setI2cAddress Fix so that driver station app resets the gamepads when switching op modes. USB-related code changes to make USB comm more responsive and to display more explicit error messages. Fix so that USB will recover properly if the USB bus returns garbage data. Fix USB initializtion race condition. Better error reporting during FTDI open. More explicit messages during USB failures. Fixed bug so that USB device is closed if event loop teardown method was not called. Fixed timer UI issue Fixed duplicate name UI bug (Legacy Module configuration). Fixed race condition in EventLoopManager. Fix to keep references stable when updating gamepad. For legacy Matrix motor/servo controllers removed necessity of appending \"Motor\" and \"Servo\" to controller names. Updated HT color sensor driver to use constants from ModernRoboticsUsbLegacyModule class. Updated MR color sensor driver to use constants from ModernRoboticsUsbDeviceInterfaceModule class. Correctly handle I2C Address change in all color sensors Updated/cleaned up op modes. Updated comments in LinearI2cAddressChange.java example op mode. Replaced the calls to \"setChannelMode\" with \"setMode\" (to match the new of the DcMotor method). Removed K9AutoTime.java op mode. Added MRGyroTest.java op mode (demonstrates how to use MR Gyro Sensor). Added MRRGBExample.java op mode (demonstrates how to use MR Color Sensor). Added HTRGBExample.java op mode (demonstrates how to use HT legacy color sensor). Added MatrixControllerDemo.java (demonstrates how to use legacy Matrix controller). Updated javadoc documentation. Updated release .apk files for Robot Controller and Driver Station apps. Release 15.10.06.002 Added support for Legacy Matrix 9.6V motor/servo controller. Cleaned up build.gradle file. Minor UI and bug fixes for driver station and robot controller apps. Throws error if Ultrasonic sensor (NXT) is not configured for legacy module port 4 or 5. Release 15.08.03.001 New user interfaces for FTC Driver Station and FTC Robot Controller apps. An init() method is added to the OpMode class. For this release, init() is triggered right before the start() method. Eventually, the init() method will be triggered when the user presses an \"INIT\" button on driver station. The init() and loop() methods are now required (i.e., need to be overridden in the user's op mode). The start() and stop() methods are optional. A new LinearOpMode class is introduced. Teams can use the LinearOpMode mode to create a linear (not event driven) program model. Teams can use blocking statements like Thread.sleep() within a linear op mode. The API for the Legacy Module and Core Device Interface Module have been updated. Support for encoders with the Legacy Module is now working. The hardware loop has been updated for better performance.",

        "description": "A list of practical projects that anyone can solve in any programming language (See solutions). These projects are divided into multiple categories, and each category has its own folder.  To get started, simply fork this repo.  CONTRIBUTING See ways of contributing to this repo. You can contribute solutions (will be published in this repo) to existing problems, add new projects, or remove existing ones. Make sure you follow all instructions properly.  Solutions You can find implementations of these projects in many other languages by other users in this repo.  Credits  Problems are motivated by the ones shared at:  Martyr2\u2019s Mega Project List Rosetta Code Table of Contents Numbers Classic Algorithms Graph Data Structures Text Networking Classes Threading Web Files Databases Graphics and Multimedia Security Numbers Find PI to the Nth Digit - Enter a number and have the program generate PI up to that many decimal places. Keep a limit to how far the program will go.  Find e to the Nth Digit - Just like the previous problem, but with e instead of PI. Enter a number and have the program generate e up to that many decimal places. Keep a limit to how far the program will go.  Fibonacci Sequence - Enter a number and have the program generate the Fibonacci sequence to that number or to the Nth number.  Prime Factorization - Have the user enter a number and find all Prime Factors (if there are any) and display them.  Next Prime Number - Have the program find prime numbers until the user chooses to stop asking for the next one.  Find Cost of Tile to Cover W x H Floor - Calculate the total cost of the tile it would take to cover a floor plan of width and height, using a cost entered by the user.  Mortgage Calculator - Calculate the monthly payments of a fixed-term mortgage over given Nth terms at a given interest rate. Also, figure out how long it will take the user to pay back the loan. For added complexity, add an option for users to select the compounding interval (Monthly, Weekly, Daily, Continually).  Change Return Program - The user enters a cost and then the amount of money given. The program will figure out the change and the number of quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies needed for the change.  Binary to Decimal and Back Converter - Develop a converter to convert a decimal number to binary or a binary number to its decimal equivalent.  Calculator - A simple calculator to do basic operators. Make it a scientific calculator for added complexity.  Unit Converter (temp, currency, volume, mass, and more) - Converts various units between one another. The user enters the type of unit being entered, the type of unit they want to convert to, and then the value. The program will then make the conversion.  Alarm Clock - A simple clock where it plays a sound after X number of minutes/seconds or at a particular time.  Distance Between Two Cities - Calculates the distance between two cities and allows the user to specify a unit of distance. This program may require finding coordinates for the cities like latitude and longitude.  Credit Card Validator - Takes in a credit card number from a common credit card vendor (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discoverer) and validates it to make sure that it is a valid number (look into how credit cards use a checksum).  Tax Calculator - Asks the user to enter a cost and either a country or state tax. It then returns the tax plus the total cost with tax.  Factorial Finder - The Factorial of a positive integer, n, is defined as the product of the sequence n, n-1, n-2, ...1, and the factorial of zero, 0, is defined as being 1. Solve this using both loops and recursion.  Complex Number Algebra - Show addition, multiplication, negation, and inversion of complex numbers in separate functions. (Subtraction and division operations can be made with pairs of these operations.) Print the results for each operation tested.  Happy Numbers - A happy number is defined by the following process. Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers, while those that do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers. Display an example of your output here. Find the first 8 happy numbers.  Number Names - Show how to spell out a number in English. You can use a preexisting implementation or roll your own, but you should support inputs up to at least one million (or the maximum value of your language's default bounded integer type if that's less).

Optional: Allow the program to read in the list of commands from a file.  GIF Creator A program that puts together multiple images (PNGs, JPGs, TIFFs) to make a smooth GIF that can be exported. Optional: Make the program convert small video files to GIFs as well.  Security Caesar cipher - Implement a Caesar cipher, both encoding, and decoding. The key is an integer from 1 to 25. This cipher rotates the letters of the alphabet (A to Z). The encoding replaces each letter with the 1st to 25th next letter in the alphabet (wrapping Z to A). So key 2 encrypts \"HI\" to \"JK\", but key 20 encrypts \"HI\" to \"BC\". This simple \"monoalphabetic substitution cipher\" provides almost no security, because an attacker who has the encoded message can either use frequency analysis to guess the key, or just try all 25 keys.",

        "description": "Project Summary This project was developed for the Computer Security course at my academic degree. Basically, it will encrypt your files in background using AES-256-CTR, a strong encryption algorithm, using RSA-4096 to secure the exchange with the server, optionally using the Tor SOCKS5 Proxy. The base functionality is what you see in the famous ransomware Cryptolocker.  The project is composed by three parts, the server, the malware and the unlocker.  The server store the victim's identification key along with the encryption key used by the malware.  The malware encrypt with a RSA-4096 (RSA-OAEP-4096 + SHA256) public key any payload before send then to the server. This approach with the optional Tor Proxy and a .onion domain allow you to hide almost completely your server.  Features Run in Background (or not) Encrypt files using AES-256-CTR(Counter Mode) with random IV for each file. Multithreaded. RSA-4096 to secure the client/server communication. Includes an Unlocker. Optional TOR Proxy support. Use an AES CTR Cypher with stream encryption to avoid load an entire file into memory. Walk all drives by default. Docker image for compilation. Building the binaries DON'T RUN ransomware.exe IN YOUR PERSONAL MACHINE, EXECUTE ONLY IN A TEST ENVIRONMENT! I'm not resposible if you acidentally encrypt all of your disks!  First of all download the project outside your $GOPATH:  git clone github.com/mauri870/ransomware cd ransomware If you have Docker skip to the next section.  You need Go at least 1.11.2 with the $GOPATH/bin in your $PATH and $GOROOT pointing to your Go installation folder. For me:  export GOPATH=~/gopath export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin export GOROOT=/usr/local/go Build the project require a lot of steps, like the RSA key generation, build three binaries, embed manifest files, so, let's leave make do your job:  make deps make You can build the server for windows with make -e GOOS=windows.  Docker ./build-docker.sh make Config Parameters You can change some of the configs during compilation. Instead of run only make, you can use the following variables:  HIDDEN='-H windowsgui' # optional. If present the malware will run in background  USE_TOR=true # optional. If present the malware will download the Tor proxy and use it to contact the server  SERVER_HOST=mydomain.com # the domain used to connect to your server. localhost, 0.0.0.0, 127.0.0.1 works too if you run the server on the same machine as the malware  SERVER_PORT=8080 # the server port, if using a domain you can set this to 80  GOOS=linux # the target os to compile the server. Eg: darwin, linux, windows Example:  make -e USE_TOR=true SERVER_HOST=mydomain.com SERVER_PORT=80 GOOS=darwin  The SERVER_ variables above only apply to the malware. The server has a flag --port that you can use to change the port that it will listen on.  DON'T RUN ransomware.exe IN YOUR PERSONAL MACHINE, EXECUTE ONLY IN A TEST ENVIRONMENT! I'm not resposible if you acidentally encrypt all of your disks!  Step by Step Demo and How it Works For this demo I'll use two machines, my personal linux machine and a windows 10 VM.  For the sake of simplicity, I have a folder mapped to the VM, so I can compile from my linux and copy to the vm.  In this demo we will use the Ngrok tool, this will allow us to expose our server using a domain, but you can use your own domain or ip address if you want. We are also going to enable the Tor transport, so .onion domains will work without problems.  First of all lets start our external domain:  ngrok http 8080 This command will give us a url like http://2af7161c.ngrok.io. Keep this command running otherwise the malware won't reach our server.  Let's compile the binaries (remember to replace the domain):  make -e SERVER_HOST=2af7161c.ngrok.io SERVER_PORT=80 USE_TOR=true The SERVER_PORT needs to be 80 in this case, since ngrok redirects 2af7161c.ngrok.io:80 to your local server port 8080.  After build, a binary called ransomware.exe, and unlocker.exe along with a folder called server will be generated in the bin folder. The execution of ransomware.exe and unlocker.exe (even if you use a diferent GOOS variable during compilation) is locked to windows machines only.  Enter the server directory from another terminal and start it:  cd bin/server && ./server --port 8080 To make sure that all is working correctly, make a http request to http://2af7161c.ngrok.io:  curl http://2af7161c.ngrok.io If you see a OK and some logs in the server output you are ready to go.  Now move the ransomware.exe and unlocker.exe to the VM along with some dummy files to test the malware. You can take a look at cmd/common.go to see some configuration options like file extensions to match, directories to scan, skipped folders, max size to match a file among others.  Then simply run the ransomware.exe and see the magic happens \ud83d\ude04.  The window that you see can be hidden using the HIDDEN option described in the compilation section.  After download, extract and start the Tor proxy, the malware waits until the tor bootstrapping is done and then proceed with the key exchange with the server. The client/server handshake takes place and the client payload, encrypted with an RSA-4096 public key must be correctly decrypted on the server. The victim identification and encryption keys are stored in a Golang embedded database called BoltDB (it also persists on disk). When completed we get into the find, match and encrypt phase, up to N-cores workers start to encrypt files matched by the patterns defined. This proccess is really quick and in seconds all of your files will be gone.  The encryption key exchanged with the server was used to encrypt all of your files. Each file has a random primitive called IV, generated individually and saved as the first 16 bytes of the encrypted content. The algorithm used is AES-256-CTR, a good AES cypher with streaming mode of operation such that the file size is left intact.  The only two sources of information available about what just happen are the READ_TO_DECRYPT.html and FILES_ENCRYPTED.html in the Desktop.  In theory, to decrypt your files you need to send an amount of BTC to the attacker's wallet, followed by a contact sending your ID(located on the file created on desktop). If the attacker can confirm your payment it will possibly(or maybe not) return your encryption key and the unlocker.exe and you can use then to recover your files. This exchange can be accomplished in several ways and WILL NOT be implemented in this project for obvious reasons.  Let's suppose you get your encryption key back. To recover the correct key point to the following url:  curl -k http://2af7161c.ngrok.io/api/keys/:id Where :id is your identification stored in the file on desktop. After, run the unlocker.exe by double click and follow the instructions.  That's it, got your files back \ud83d\ude04  The server has only two endpoints:  POST api/keys/add - Used by the malware to persist new keys. Some verifications are made, like the verification of the RSA autenticity. Returns 204 (empty content) in case of success or a json error.  GET api/keys/:id - Id is a 32 characters parameter, representing an Id already persisted. Returns a json containing the encryption key or a json error  The end As you can see, building a functional ransomware, with some of the best existing algorithms is not difficult, anyone with some programming skills can build that in any programming language.",

        "description": "What is Python? Executive Summary Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.   Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides. Since there is no compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast. Debugging Python programs is easy: a bug or bad input will never cause a segmentation fault. Instead, when the interpreter discovers an error, it raises an exception. When the program doesn't catch the exception, the interpreter prints a stack trace. A source level debugger allows inspection of local and global variables, evaluation of arbitrary expressions, setting breakpoints, stepping through the code a line at a time, and so on. The debugger is written in Python itself, testifying to Python's introspective power. On the other hand, often the quickest way to debug a program is to add a few print statements to the source: the fast edit-test-debug cycle makes this simple approach very effective.  What is Python? Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.  It is used for:  web development (server-side), software development, mathematics, system scripting.  What can Python do?  Python can be used on a server to create web applications. Python can be used alongside software to create workflows. Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files. Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics. Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.  Why Python?  Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc). Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language. Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages. Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick. Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.  Good to know  The most recent major version of Python is Python 3, which we shall be using in this tutorial. However, Python 2, although not being updated with anything other than security updates, is still quite popular. In this tutorial Python will be written in a text editor. It is possible to write Python in an Integrated Development Environment, such as Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse which are particularly useful when managing larger collections of Python files.  Python Syntax compared to other programming languages  Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics. Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses. Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.  Applications for Python  Python is used in many application domains. Here's a sampling.  The Python Package Index lists thousands of third party modules for Python.  Web and Internet Development  Python offers many choices for web development:  Frameworks such as Django and Pyramid. Micro-frameworks such as Flask and Bottle. Advanced content management systems such as Plone and django CMS.  Python's standard library supports many Internet protocols:  HTML and XML JSON E-mail processing. Support for FTP, IMAP, and other Internet protocols. Easy-to-use socket interface.  And the Package Index has yet more libraries:  Requests, a powerful HTTP client library. Beautiful Soup, an HTML parser that can handle all sorts of oddball HTML. Feedparser for parsing RSS/Atom feeds. Paramiko, implementing the SSH2 protocol. Twisted Python, a framework for asynchronous network programming.  Scientific and Numeric  Python is widely used in scientific and numeric computing:  SciPy is a collection of packages for mathematics, science, and engineering.  Pandas is a data analysis and modeling library. IPython is a powerful interactive shell that features easy editing and recording of a work session, and supports visualizations and parallel computing.  The Software Carpentry Course teaches basic skills for scientific computing, running bootcamps and providing open-access teaching materials. Education Python is a superb language for teaching programming, both at the introductory level and in more advanced courses.  Books such as How to Think Like a Computer Scientist, Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science, and Practical Programming. The Education Special Interest Group is a good place to discuss teaching issues. Desktop GUIs The Tk GUI library is included with most binary distributions of Python.  Some toolkits that are usable on several platforms are available separately:  wxWidgets Kivy, for writing multitouch applications. Qt via pyqt or pyside Platform-specific toolkits are also available:  GTK+ Microsoft Foundation Classes through the win32 extensions Software Development Python is often used as a support language for software developers, for build control and management, testing, and in many other ways.  SCons for build control.  Buildbot and Apache Gump for automated continuous compilation and testing. Roundup or Trac for bug tracking and project management. Business Applications Python is also used to build ERP and e-commerce systems:  Odoo is an all-in-one management software that offers a range of business applications that form a complete suite of enterprise management applications. Try ton is a three-tier high-level general purpose application platform.",

C# has roots from the C family, and the language is close to other popular languages like C++ and Java.  The first version was released in year 2002. The latest version, C# 8, was released in September 2019.  C# is a modern object-oriented programming language developed in 2000 by Anders Hejlsberg, the principal designer and lead architect at Microsoft. It is pronounced as \"C-Sharp,\" inspired by the musical notation \u201c\u266f\u201d which stands for a note with a slightly higher pitch. As it\u2019s considered an incremental compilation of the C++ language, the name C \u201csharp\u201d seemed most appropriate. The sharp symbol, however, has been replaced by the keyboard friendly \u201c#\u201d as a suffix to \u201cC\u201d for purposes of programming.  Although the code is very similar to C++, C# is newer and has grown fast with extensive support from Microsoft. The fact that it\u2019s so similar to Java syntactically helps explain why it has emerged as one of the most popular programming languages today.   C# is pronounced \"C-Sharp\".  It is an object-oriented programming language created by Microsoft that runs on the .NET Framework.  C# has roots from the C family, and the language is close to other popular languages like C++ and Java.  The first version was released in year 2002. The latest version, C# 8, was released in September 2019.  C# is used for:  Mobile applications Desktop applications Web applications Web services Web sites Games VR Database applications And much, much more!  An Introduction to C# Programming  C# is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language that is structured and easy to learn. It runs on Microsoft\u2019s .Net Framework and can be compiled on a variety of computer platforms. As the syntax is simple and easy to learn, developers familiar with C, C++, or Java have found a comfort zone within C#.  C# is a boon for developers who want to build a wide range of applications on the .NET Framework\u2014Windows applications, Web applications, and Web services\u2014in addition to building mobile apps, Windows Store apps, and enterprise software. It is thus considered a powerful programming language and features in every developer\u2019s cache of tools.  Although first released in 2002, when it was introduced with .NET Framework 1.0, the C# language has evolved a great deal since then. The most recent version is C# 8.0, available in preview as part of Visual Studio. To get access to all of the new language features, you would need to install the latest preview version of .NET Core 3.0.   C# is used for:  Mobile applications Desktop applications Web applications Web services Web sites Games VR Database applications And much, much more!  Why Use C#?  It is one of the most popular programming language in the world It is easy to learn and simple to use It has a huge community support C# is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs. As C# is close to C, C++ and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C# or vice versa.   The C# Environment  You need the .NET Framework and an IDE (integrated development environment) to work with the C# language.  The .NET Framework  The .NET Framework platform of the Windows OS is required to write web and desktop-based applications using not only C# but also Visual Basic and Jscript, as the platform provides language interoperability. Besides, the .Net Framework allows C# to communicate with any of the other common languages, such as C++, Jscript, COBOL, and so on.   IDEs  Microsoft provides various IDEs for C# programming:  Visual Studio 2010 (VS) Visual Studio Express Visual Web Developer Visual Studio Code (VSC)  The C# source code files can be written using a basic text editor, like Notepad, and compiled using the command-line compiler of the .NET Framework.   Alternative open-source versions of the .Net Framework can work on other operating systems as well. For instance, the Mono has a C# compiler and runs on several operating systems, including Linux, Mac, Android, BSD, iOS, Windows, Solaris, and UNIX. This brings enhanced development tools to the developer.   As C# is part of the .Net Framework platform, it has access to its enormous library of codes and components, such as Common Language Runtime (CLR), the .Net Framework Class Library, Common Language Specification, Common Type System, Metadata and Assemblies, Windows Forms, ASP.Net and ASP.Net AJAX, Windows Workflow Foundation (WF), Windows Communication Foundation (WCF), and LINQ.   C# and Java  C# and Java are high-level programming languages that share several similarities (as well as many differences). They are both object-oriented languages much influenced by C++. But while C# is suitable for application development in the Microsoft ecosystem from the front, Java is considered best for client-side web applications. Also, while C# has many tools for programming, Java has a larger arsenal of tools to choose from in IDEs and Text Editors.   C# is used for virtual reality projects like games, mobile, and web applications. It is built specifically for Microsoft platforms and several non-Microsoft-based operating systems, like the Mono Project that works with Linux and OS X.  Java is used for creating messaging applications and developing web-based and enterprise-based applications in open-source ecosystems.  Both C# and Java support arrays. However, each language uses them differently. In C#, arrays are a specialization of the system; in Java, they are a direct specialization of the object.   The C# programming language executes on the CLR. The source code is interpreted into bytecode, which is further compiled by the CLR. Java runs on any platform with the assistance of JRE (Java Runtime Environment). The written source code is first compiled into bytecode and then converted into machine code to be executed on a JRE.   C# and C++   Although C# and C++ are both C-based languages with similar code, there are some differences. For one, C# is considered a component-oriented programming language, while C++ is a partial object-oriented language. Also, while both languages are compiled languages, C# compiles to CLR and is interpreted by.NET, but C++ compiles to machine code. The size of binaries in C# is much larger than in C++.  Other differences between the two include the following:  C# gives compiler errors and warnings, but C++ doesn\u2019t support warnings, which may cause damage to the OS. C# runs in a virtual machine for automatic memory management. C++ requires you to manage memory manually. C# can create Windows, .NET, web, desktop, and mobile applications, but not stand-alone apps. C++ can create server-side, stand-alone, and console applications as it can work directly with the hardware. C++ can be used on any platform, while C# is targeted toward Windows OS. Generally, C++ being faster than C#, the former is preferred for applications where performance is essential.    Features of C#  The C# programming language has many features that make it more useful and unique when compared to other languages, including:   Object-oriented language Being object-oriented, C# allows the creation of modular applications and reusable codes, an advantage over C++. As an object-oriented language, C# makes development and maintenance easier when project size grows. It supports all three object-oriented features: data encapsulation, inheritance, interfaces, and polymorphism.  Simplicity C# is a simple language with a structured approach to problem-solving. Unsafe operations, like direct memory manipulation, are not allowed.  Speed The compilation and execution time in C# is very powerful and fast.   A Modern programming language C# programming is used for building scalable and interoperable applications with support for modern features like automatic garbage collection, error handling, debugging, and robust security. It has built-in support for a web service to be invoked from any app running on any platform.  Type-safe Arrays and objects are zero base indexed and bound checked. There is an automatic checking of the overflow of types. The C# type safety instances support robust programming.  Interoperability Language interoperability of C# maximizes code reuse for the efficiency of the development process. C# programs can work upon almost anything as a program can call out any native API.  Consistency Its unified type system enables developers to extend the type system simply and easily for consistent behavior.  Updateable C# is automatically updateable. Its versioning support enables complex frameworks to be developed and evolved.  Component oriented C# supports component-oriented programming through the concepts of properties, methods, events, and attributes for self-contained and self-describing components of functionality for robust and scalable applications.  Structured Programming Language The structured design and modularization in C# break a problem into parts, using functions for easy implementation to solve significant problems.  Rich Library C# has a standard library with many inbuilt functions for easy and fast development.   Prerequisites for Learning C#   Basic knowledge of C or C++ or any programming language or programming fundamentals.   Additionally, the OOP concept makes for a short learning curve of C#.   Advantages of C#   There are many advantages to the C# language that makes it a useful programming language compared to other languages like Java, C, or C++. These include:  Being an object-oriented language, C# allows you to create modular, maintainable applications and reusable codes  Familiar syntax  Easy to develop as it has a rich class of libraries for smooth implementation of functions   Enhanced integration as an application written in .NET will integrate and interpret better when compared to other NET technologies   As C# runs on CLR, it makes it easy to integrate with components written in other languages  It\u2019s safe, with no data loss as there is no type-conversion so that you can write secure codes  The automatic garbage collection keeps the system clean and doesn\u2019t hang it during execution  As your machine has to install the .NET Framework to run C#, it supports cross-platform  Strong memory backup prevents memory leakage   Programming support of the Microsoft ecosystem makes development easy and seamless  Low maintenance cost, as C# can develop iOS, Android, and Windows Phone native apps  The syntax is similar to C, C++, and Java, which makes it easier to learn and work with C#  Useful as it can develop iOS, Android, and Windows Phone native apps with the Xamarin Framework  C# is the most powerful programming language for the .NET Framework  Fast development as C# is open source steered by Microsoft with access to open source projects and tools on Github, and many active communities contributing to the improvement  What Can C Sharp Do for You?  C# can be used to develop a wide range of:  Windows client applications Windows libraries and components Windows services Web applications Native iOS and Android mobile apps Azure cloud applications and services Gaming consoles and gaming systems Video and virtual reality games Interoperability software like SharePoint Enterprise software Backend services and database programs AI and ML applications Distributed applications Hardware-level programming Virus and malware software GUI-based applications IoT devices Blockchain and distributed ledger technology   C# Programming for Beginners: Introduction, Features and Applications By Simplilearn Last updated on Jan 20, 2020674 C# Programming for Beginners As a programmer, you\u2019re motivated to master the most popular languages that will give you an edge in your career.

We will use AWS to launch and host the Linux server. AWS might seem a little confusing at this point. Don\u2019t worry, we will gain much more hands-on experience with AWS throughout the course. The goal is to get you comfortable working with the technology and not overwhelm you with all the details.  Requirements You need to have a personal AWS account and GitHub account for this assignment. You should also read the Git Hands-on Guide and Linux Hands-on Guide before beginning this exercise.  A word about grading One of the key DevOps practices we learn about in this class is the use of automation to increase the speed and repeatability of processes. Automation is utilized during the assignment grading process to review and assess your work.  It\u2019s important that you follow the instructions in each assignment and type in required files and resources with the proper names. All names are case sensitive, so a name like \"Web1\" is not the same as \"web1\". If you misspell a name, use the wrong case, or put a file in the wrong directory location you will lose points on your assignment. This is the easiest way to lose points, and also the most preventable. You should always double-check your work to make sure it accurately reflects the requirements specified in the assignment. You should always carefully review the content of your files before submitting your assignment.  The assignment Let\u2019s get started!  Create GitHub repository The first step in the assignment is to setup a Git repository on GitHub. We will use a special solution called GitHub Classroom for this course which automates the process of setting up student assignment repositories.  Here are the basic steps:  Click on the following link to open Assignment 2 on the GitHub Classroom site: https://classroom.github.com/a/K4zcVmX- (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.  Click on the Accept this assignment button.  GitHub Classroom will provide you with a URL (https) to access the assignment repository. Either copy this address to your clipboard or write it down somewhere. You will need to use this address to set up the repository on a Linux server.  Example: https://github.com/UST-SEIS665/hw2-seis665-02-spring2019-<your github id>.git At this point your new repository to ready to use. The repository is currently empty. We will put some content in there soon!  Launch Linux server The second step in the assignment is to launch a Linux server using AWS EC2. The server should have the following characteristics:  Amazon Linux 2 AMI 64-bit (usually the first option listed)  Located in a U.S. region (us-east-1)  t2.micro instance type  All default instance settings (storage, vpm, security group, etc.)  I\u2019ve shown you how to launch EC2 instances in class. You can review it on Canvas.  Once you launch the new server, it may take a few minutes to provision.  Log into server The next step is to log into the Linux server using a terminal program with a secure shell (SSH) support. You can use iTerm2 (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. on a Mac and GitBash/PuTTY (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. on a PC.  You will need to have the private server key and the public IP address before attempting to log into the server. The server key is basically your password. If you lose it, you will need to terminate the existing instance and launch a new server. I recommend reusing the same key when launching new servers throughout the class. Note, I make this recommendation to make the learning process easier and not because it is a common security practice.  I\u2019ve shown you how to use a terminal application to log into the instance using a Windows desktop. Your personal computer or lab computer may be running a different OS version, but the process is still very similar. You can review the videos on the Canvas.  Working with Linux If you\u2019ve made it this far, congratulations! You\u2019ve made it over the toughest hurdle. By the end of this course, I promise you will be able to launch and log into servers in your sleep.  You should be looking at a login screen that looks something like this:  Last login: Mon Mar 21 21:17:54 2016 from 174-20-199-194.mpls.qwest.net  __|  __|_  )  _|  (     /   Amazon Linux AMI ___|\\___|___| https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-ami/2015.09-release-notes/ 8 package(s) needed for security, out of 17 available Run \"sudo yum update\" to apply all updates. ec2-user@ip-172-31-15-26 ~]$ Your terminal cursor is sitting at the shell prompt, waiting for you to type in your first command. Remember the shell? It is a really cool program that lets you start other programs and manage services on the Linux system. The rest of this assignment will be spent working with the shell.  Note, when you are asked to type in a command in the steps below, don\u2019t type in the dollar-sign ($) character. This is just meant to represent the command prompt. The actual commands are represented by the characters to the right of the command prompt.  Let\u2019s start by asking the shell for some help. Type in:  $ help The shell provides you with a list of commands you can run along with possible command options.  Next, check out one of the pages in the built-in manual:  $ man ls A man page will appear with information on how to use the ls command. This command is used to list the contents of file directories. Either space through the contents of the man page or hit q to exit.  Most of the core Linux commands have man pages available. But honestly, some of these man pages are a bit hard to understand. Sometimes your best bet is to search on Google if you are trying to figure out how to use a specific command.  When you initially log into Linux, the system places you in your home directory. Each user on the system has a separate home directory. Let\u2019s see where your home directory is located:  $ pwd The response should be /home/ec2-user. The pwd command is handy to remember if you ever forget what file directory you are currently located in. If you recall from the Linux Hands-on Guide, this directory is also your current working directory.  Type in:  $ cd / The cd command let\u2019s you change to a new working directory on the server. In this case, we changed to the root (/) directory. This is the parent of all the other directories on the file system.  Type in:  $ ls The ls command lists the contents of the current directory. As you can see, root directory contains many other directories. You will become familiar with these directories over time.  The ls command provides a very basic directory listing. You need to supply the command with some options if you want to see more detailed information.  Type in:  $ ls -la See how this command provides you with much more detailed information about the files and directories? You can use this detailed listing to see the owner, group, and access control list settings for each file or directory. Do you see any files listed? Remember, the first character in the access control list column denotes whether a listed item is a file or a directory.  You probably see a couple files with names like .autofsck. How come you didn\u2019t see this file when you typed in the lscommand without any options? (Try to run this command again to convince yourself.) Files names that start with a period are called hidden files. These files won\u2019t appear on normal directory listings.  Type in:  $ cd /var Then, type in:  $ ls You will see a directory listing for the /var directory. Next, type in:  $ ls .. Huh. This directory listing looks the same as the earlier root directory listing. When you use two periods (..) in a directory path that means you are referring to the parent directory of the current directory. Just think of the two dots as meaning the directory above the current directory.  Now, type in:  $ cd ~ $ pwd Whoa. We\u2019re back at our home directory again. The tilde character (~) is another one of those handy little directory path shortcuts. It always refers to our personal home directory. Keep in mind that since every user has their own home directory, the tilde shortcut will refer to a unique directory for each logged-in user.  Most students are used to navigating a file system by clicking a mouse in nested graphical folders. When they start using a command-line to navigate a file system, they sometimes get confused and lose track of their current position in the file system. Remember, you can always use the pwd command to quickly figure out what directory you are currently working in.  Let\u2019s make some changes to the file system. We can easily make our own directories on the file system. Type:  mkdir test Now type:  ls Cool, there\u2019s our new test directory. Let\u2019s pretend we don\u2019t like that directory name and delete it. Type:  rmdir test Now it\u2019s gone. How can you be sure? You should know how to check to see if the directory still exists at this point. Go ahead and check.  Let\u2019s create another directory. Type in:  $ mkdir documents Next, change to the new directory:  $ cd documents Did you notice that your command prompt displays the name of the current directory? Something like: [ec2-user@ip-172-31-15-26 documents]$. Pretty handy, huh?  Okay, let\u2019s create our first file in the documents directory. This is just an empty file for training purposes. Type in:  $ touch paper.txt Check to see that the new file is in the directory. Now, go back to the previous directory. Remember the double dot shortcut?  $ cd .. Okay, we don\u2019t like our documents directory any more. Let\u2019s blow it away. Type in:  $ rmdir documents Uh oh. The shell didn\u2019t like that command because the directory isn\u2019t empty. Let\u2019s change back into the documents directory. But this time don\u2019t type in the full name of the directory. You can let shell auto-completion do the typing for you. Type in the first couple characters of the directory name and then hit the tab key:  $ cd doc<tab> You should use the tab auto-completion feature often. It saves typing and makes working with the Linux file system much much easier. Tab is your friend.  Now, remove the file by typing:  $ rm paper.txt Did you try to use the tab key instead of typing in the whole file name? Check to make sure the file was deleted from the directory.  Next, create a new file:  $ touch file1 We like file1 so much that we want to make a backup copy. Type:  $ cp file1 file1-backup Check to make sure the new backup copy was created. We don\u2019t really like the name of that new file, so let\u2019s rename it. Type:  $ mv file1-backup backup Moving a file to the same directory and giving it a new name is basically the same thing as renaming it. We could have moved it to a different directory if we wanted.  Let\u2019s list all of the files in the current directory that start with the letter f:  $ ls f* Using wildcard pattern matching in file commands is really useful if you want the command to impact or filter a group of files. Now, go up one directory to the parent directory (remember the double dot shortcut?)  We tried to remove the documents directory earlier when it had files in it. Obviously that won\u2019t work again. However, we can use a more powerful command to destroy the directory and vanquish its contents. Behold, the all powerful remove command:  $ rm -fr documents Did you remember to use auto-completion when typing in documents? This command and set of options forcibly removes the directory and its contents. It\u2019s a dangerous command wielded by the mightiest Linux wizards. Okay, maybe that\u2019s a bit of an exaggeration. Just be careful with it.  Check to make sure the documents directory is gone before proceeding.  Let\u2019s continue. Change to the directory /var and make a directory called test.  Ugh. Permission denied. We created this darn Linux server and we paid for it. Shouldn\u2019t we be able to do anything we want on it? You logged into the system as a user called ec2-user. While this user can create and manage files in its home directory, it cannot change files all across the system. At least it can\u2019t as a normal user. The ec2-user is a member of the root group, so it can escalate its privileges to super-user status when necessary. Let\u2019s try it:  $ sudo mkdir test Check to make sure the directory exists now. Using sudo we can execute commands as a super-user. We can do anything we want now that we know this powerful new command.  Go ahead and delete the test directory. Did you remember to use sudo before the rmdir command? Check to make sure the directory is gone.  You might be asking yourself the question: why can we list the contents of the /var directory but not make changes? That\u2019s because all users have read access to the /var directory and the ls command is a read function. Only the root users or those acting as a super-user can write changes to the directory.  Let\u2019s go back to our home directory:  $ cd ~ Editing text files is a really common task on Linux systems because many of the application configuration files are text files. We can create a text file by using a text editor. Type in:  $ nano myfile.conf The shell starts up the nano text editor and places your terminal cursor in the editing screen. Nano is a simple text-based word processor. Type in a few lines of text. When you\u2019re done writing your novel, hit ctrl-x and answer y to the prompt to save your work. Finally, hit enter to save the text to the filename you specified.  Check to see that your file was saved in the directory. You can take a look at the contents of your file by typing:  $ cat myfile.conf The cat command displays your text file content on the terminal screen. This command works fine for displaying small text files. But if your file is hundreds of lines long, the content will scroll down your terminal screen so fast that you won\u2019t be able to easily read it. There\u2019s a better way to view larger text files. Type in:  $ less myfile.conf The less command will page the display of a text file, allowing you to page through the contents of the file using the space bar. Your text file is probably too short to see the paging in action though. Hit q to quit out of the less text viewer.  Hit the up-arrow key on your keyboard a few times until the commmand nano myfile.conf appears next to your command prompt. Cool, huh? The up-arrow key allows you to replay a previously run command. Linux maintains a list of all the commands you have run since you logged into the server. This is called the command history. It\u2019s a really useful feature if you have to re-run a complex command again.  Now, hit ctrl-c. This cancels whatever command is displayed on the command line.  Type in the following command to create a couple empty files in the directory:  $ touch file1 file2 file3 Confirm that the files were created. Some commands, like touch. allow you to specify multiple files as arguments. You will find that Linux commands have all kinds of ways to make tasks more efficient like this.  Throughout this assignment, we have been running commands and viewing results on the terminal screen. The screen is the standard place for commands to output results. It\u2019s known as the standard out (stdout). However, it\u2019s really useful to output results to the file system sometimes. Type in:  $ ls > listing.txt Take a look at the directory listing now. You just created a new file. View the contents of the listing.txt file. What do you see? Instead of sending the output from the ls command to the screen we sent it to a text file.  Let\u2019s try another one. Type:  $ cat myfile.conf > listing.txt Take a look at the contents of the listing.txt file again. It looks like your myfile.conf file now. It\u2019s like you made a copy of it. But what happened to the previous content in the listing.txt file? When you redirect the output of a command using the right angle-bracket character (>), the output overwrites the existing file. Type this command in:  $ cat myfile.conf >> listing.txt Now look at the contents of the listing.txt file. You should see your original content displayed twice. When you use two angle-bracket characters in the commmand the output appends (or adds to) the file instead of overwriting it.  We redirected the output from a command to a text file. It\u2019s also possible to redirect the input to a command. Typically we use a keyboard to provide input, but sometimes it makes more sense to input a file to a command. For example, how many words are in your new listing.txt file? Let\u2019s find out. Type in:  $ wc -w < listing.txt Did you get a number? This command inputs the listing.txt file into a word count program called wc.  Type in the command:  $ ls /usr/bin The terminal screen probably scrolled quickly as filenames flashed by. The /usr/bin directory holds quite a few files. It would be nice if we could page through the contents of this directory. Well, we can. We can use a special shell feature called pipes. In previous steps, we redirected I/O using the file system. Pipes allow us to redirect I/O between programs. We can redirect the output from one program into another. Type in:  $ ls /usr/bin | less Now the directory listing is paged. Hit the spacebar to page through the listing. The pipe, represented by a vertical bar character (|), takes the output from the ls command and redirects it to the less command where the resulting output is paged. Pipes are super powerful and used all the time by savvy Linux operators.  Hit the q key to quit the paginated directory listing command.  Working with shell scripts Now things are going to get interesting.  We\u2019ve been manually typing in commands throughout this exercise. If we were running a set of repetitive tasks, we would want to automate the process as much as possible. The shell makes it really easy to automate tasks using shell scripts. The shell provides many of the same features as a basic procedural programming language. Let\u2019s write some code.  Type in this command:  $ j=123 $ echo $j We just created a variable named j referencing the string 123. The echo command printed out the value of the variable. We had to use a dollar sign ($) when referencing the variable in another command.  Next, type in:  $ j=1+1 $ echo $j Is that what you expected? The shell just interprets the variable value as a string. It\u2019s not going to do any sort of computation.  Typing in shell script commands on the command line is sort of pointless. We want to be able to create scripts that we can run over-and-over. Let\u2019s create our first shell script.  Use the nano editor to create a file named myscript. When the file is open in the editor, type in the following lines of code:  #!/bin/bash echo Hello $1 Now quit the editor and save your file. We can run our script by typing:  $ ./myscript World Er, what happened? Permission denied. Didn\u2019t we create this file? Why can\u2019t we run it? We can\u2019t run the script file because we haven\u2019t set the execute permission on the file. Type in:  $ chmod u+x myscript This modifies the file access control list to allow the owner of the file to execute it. Let\u2019s try to run the command again. Hit the up-arrow key a couple times until the ./myscript World command is displayed and hit enter.  Hooray! Our first shell script. It\u2019s probably a bit underwhelming. No problem, we\u2019ll make it a little more complex. The script took a single argument called World. Any arguments provided to a shell script are represented as consecutively numbered variables inside the script ($1, $2, etc). Pretty simple.  You might be wondering why we had to type the ./ characters before the name of our script file. Try to type in the command without them:  $ myscript World Command not found. That seems a little weird. Aren\u2019t we currently in the directory where the shell script is located? Well, that\u2019s just not how the shell works. When you enter a command into the shell, it looks for the command in a predefined set of directories on the server called your PATH. Since your script file isn\u2019t in your special path, the shell reports it as not found. By typing in the ./ characters before the command name you are basically forcing the shell to look for your script in the current directory instead of the default path.  Create another file called cleanup using nano. In the file editor window type:  #!/bin/bash # My cleanup script mkdir archive mv file* archive Exit the editor window and save the file. Change the permissions on the script file so that you can execute it. Now run the command:  $ ./cleanup Take a look at the file directory listing. Notice the archive directory? List the contents of that directory. The script automatically created a new directory and moved three files into it. Anything you can do manually at a command prompt can be automated using a shell script.  Let\u2019s create one more shell script. Use nano to create a script called namelist. Here is the content of the script:  #!/bin/bash # for-loop test script names='Jason John Jane' for i in $names do   echo Hello $i done Change the permissions on the script file so that you can execute it. Run the command:  $ ./namelist The script will loop through a set of names stored in a variable displaying each one. Scripts support several programming constructs like for-loops, do-while loops, and if-then-else. These building blocks allow you to create fairly complex scripts for automating tasks.  Installing packages and services We\u2019re nearing the end of this assignment. But before we finish, let\u2019s install some new software packages on our server. The first thing we should do is make sure all the current packages installed on our Linux server are up-to-date. Type in:  $ sudo yum update -y This is one of those really powerful commands that requires sudo access. The system will review the currently installed packages and go out to the Internet and download appropriate updates.  Next, let\u2019s install an Apache web server on our system. Type in:  $ sudo yum install httpd -y Bam! You probably never knew that installing a web server was so easy. We\u2019re not going to actually use the web server in this exercise, but we will in future assignments.  We installed the web server, but is it actually running? Let\u2019s check. Type in:  $ sudo service httpd status Nope. Let\u2019s start it. Type:  $ sudo service httpd start We can use the service command to control the services running on the system. Let\u2019s setup the service so that it automatically starts when the system boots up. Type in:  $ sudo chkconfig httpd on Cool. We installed the Apache web server on our system, but what other programs are currently running? We can use the pscommand to find out. Type in:  $ ps -ax Lots of processes are running on our system. We can even look at the overall performance of our system using the topcommand. Let\u2019s try that now. Type in:  $ top The display might seem a little overwhelming at first. You should see lots of performance information displayed including the cpu usage, free memory, and a list of running tasks.  We\u2019re almost across the finish line. Let\u2019s make sure all of our valuable work is stored in a git repository. First, we need to install git. Type in the command:  $ sudo yum install git -y Check your work It\u2019s very important to check your work before submitting it for grading. A misspelled, misplaced or missing file will cost you points. This may seem harsh, but the reality is that these sorts of mistakes have consequences in the real world. For example, a server instance could fail to launch properly and impact customers because a single required file is missing.  Here is what the contents of your git repository should look like before final submission:  \u2523archive \u2503  \u2523 file1 \u2503  \u2523 file2 \u2503  \u2517 file3 \u2523 namelist \u2517 myfile.conf  Saving our work in the git repository Next, make sure you are still in your home directory (/home/ec2-user). We will install the git repository you created at the beginning of this exercise. You will need to modify this command by typing in the GitHub repository URL you copied earlier.  $ git clone <your GitHub URL here>.git Example: git clone https://github.com/UST-SEIS665/hw2-seis665-02-spring2019-<your github id>.git The git application will ask you for your GitHub username and password. Note, if you have multi-factor authentication enabled on your GitHub account you will need to provide a personal token instead of your password.  Git will clone (copy) the repository from GitHub to your Linux server. Since the repository is empty the clone happens almost instantly. Check to make sure that a sub-directory called \"hw2-seis665-02-spring2019-<username>\" exists in the current directory (where <username> is your GitHub account name). Git automatically created this directory as part of the cloning process.  Change to the hw2-seis665-02-spring2019-<username> directory and type:  $ ls -la Notice the .git hidden directory? This is where git actually stores all of the file changes in your repository. Nothing is actually in your repository yet.  Change back to the parent directory (cd ..). Next, let\u2019s move some of our files into the repository. Type:  $ mv archive hw2-seis665-02-spring2019-<username> $ mv namelist hw2-seis665-02-spring2019-<username> $ mv myfile.conf hw2-seis665-02-spring2019-<username> Hopefully, you remembered to use the auto-complete function to reduce some of that typing. Change to the hw2-seis665-02-spring2019-<username> directory and list the directory contents. Your files are in the working directory, but are not actually stored in the repository because they haven\u2019t been committed yet.  Type in:  $ git status You should see a list of untracked files. Let\u2019s tell git that we want these files tracked. Type in:  $ git add * Now type in the git status command again. Notice how all the files are now being tracked and are ready to be committed. These files are in the git staging area. We\u2019ll commit them to the repository next. Type:  $ git commit -m 'assignment 2 files' Next, take a look at the commit log. Type:  $ git log You should see your commit listed along with an assigned hash (long string of random-looking characters).  Finally, let\u2019s save the repository to our GitHub account. Type in:  $ git push origin master The git client will ask you for your GitHub username and password before pushing the repository.  Go back to the GitHub.com website and login if you have been logged out. Click on the repository link for the assignment. Do you see your files listed there? Congratulations, you completed the exercise!  Terminate server  The last step is to terminate your Linux instance. AWS will bill you for every hour the instance is running. The cost is nominal, but there\u2019s no need to rack up unnecessary charges.  Here are the steps to terminate your instance:  Log into your AWS account and click on the EC2 dashboard.  Click the Instances menu item.  Select your server in the instances table.  Click on the Actions drop down menu above the instances table.  Select the Instance State menu option  Click on the Terminate action.  Your Linux instance will shutdown and disappear in a few minutes. The EC2 dashboard will continue to display the instance on your instance listing for another day or so. However, the state of the instance will be terminated.  Submitting your assignment \u2014 IMPORTANT! If you haven\u2019t already, please e-mail me your GitHub username in order to receive credit for this assignment. There is no need to email me to tell me that you have committed your work to GitHub or to ask me if your GitHub submission worked. If you can see your work in your GitHub repository, I can see your work.",

This API is the only way to automate chat functionalities on a user account. We do this by emulating the browser. This means doing the exact same GET/POST requests and tricking Facebook into thinking we're accessing the website normally. Because we're doing it this way, this API won't work with an auth token but requires the credentials of a Facebook account.  _Disclaimer_: We are not responsible if your account gets banned for spammy activities such as sending lots of messages to people you don't know, sending messages very quickly, sending spammy looking URLs, logging in and out very quickly... Be responsible Facebook citizens.  See [below](#projects-using-this-api) for projects using this API.  ## Install If you just want to use fca-unofficial, you should use this command: ```bash npm install procodermew/fca-unofficial ``` It will download `fca-unofficial` from NPM repositories  ## Testing your bots If you want to test your bots without creating another account on Facebook, you can use [Facebook Whitehat Accounts](https://www.facebook.com/whitehat/accounts/).  ## Example Usage ```javascript const login = require(\"fca-unofficial\");  // Create simple echo bot login({email: \"FB_EMAIL\", password: \"FB_PASSWORD\"}, (err, api) => {     if(err) return console.error(err);      api.listen((err, message) => {         api.sendMessage(message.body, message.threadID);     }); }); ```  Result:  <img width=\"517\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-11-04 at 14 36 00\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4534692/20023545/f8c24130-a29d-11e6-9ef7-47568bdbc1f2.png\">   ## Documentation  You can see it [here](DOCS.md).  ## Main Functionality  ### Sending a message #### api.sendMessage(message, threadID[, callback][, messageID])  Various types of message can be sent: * *Regular:* set field `body` to the desired message as a string. * *Sticker:* set a field `sticker` to the desired sticker ID. * *File or image:* Set field `attachment` to a readable stream or an array of readable streams. * *URL:* set a field `url` to the desired URL. * *Emoji:* set field `emoji` to the desired emoji as a string and set field `emojiSize` with size of the emoji (`small`, `medium`, `large`)  Note that a message can only be a regular message (which can be empty) and optionally one of the following: a sticker, an attachment or a url.  __Tip__: to find your own ID, you can look inside the cookies. The `userID` is under the name `c_user`.  __Example (Basic Message)__ ```js const login = require(\"fca-unofficial\");  login({email: \"FB_EMAIL\", password: \"FB_PASSWORD\"}, (err, api) => {     if(err) return console.error(err);      var yourID = \"000000000000000\";     var msg = \"Hey!\";     api.sendMessage(msg, yourID); }); ```  __Example (File upload)__ ```js const login = require(\"fca-unofficial\");  login({email: \"FB_EMAIL\", password: \"FB_PASSWORD\"}, (err, api) => {     if(err) return console.error(err);      // Note this example uploads an image called image.jpg     var yourID = \"000000000000000\";     var msg = {         body: \"Hey!\",         attachment: fs.createReadStream(__dirname + '/image.jpg')     }     api.sendMessage(msg, yourID); }); ```  ------------------------------------ ### Saving session.  To avoid logging in every time you should save AppState (cookies etc.) to a file, then you can use it without having password in your scripts.  __Example__  ```js const fs = require(\"fs\"); const login = require(\"fca-unofficial\");  var credentials = {email: \"FB_EMAIL\", password: \"FB_PASSWORD\"};  login(credentials, (err, api) => {     if(err) return console.error(err);      fs.writeFileSync('appstate.json', JSON.stringify(api.getAppState())); }); ```  Alternative: Use [c3c-fbstate](https://github.com/c3cbot/c3c-fbstate) to get fbstate.json (appstate.json)  ------------------------------------  ### Listening to a chat #### api.listen(callback)  Listen watches for messages sent in a chat. By default this won't receive events (joining/leaving a chat, title change etc\u2026) but it can be activated with `api.setOptions({listenEvents: true})`. This will by default ignore messages sent by the current account, you can enable listening to your own messages with `api.setOptions({selfListen: true})`.  __Example__  ```js const fs = require(\"fs\"); const login = require(\"fca-unofficial\");  // Simple echo bot. It will repeat everything that you say. // Will stop when you say '/stop' login({appState: JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('appstate.json', 'utf8'))}, (err, api) => {     if(err) return console.error(err);      api.setOptions({listenEvents: true});      var stopListening = api.listenMqtt((err, event) => {         if(err) return console.error(err);          api.markAsRead(event.threadID, (err) => {             if(err) console.error(err);         });          switch(event.type) {             case \"message\":                 if(event.body === '/stop') {                     api.sendMessage(\"Goodbye\u2026\", event.threadID);                     return stopListening();                 }                 api.sendMessage(\"TEST BOT: \" + event.body, event.threadID);                 break;             case \"event\":                 console.log(event);                 break;         }     }); }); ```  ## FAQS  1. How do I run tests? > For tests, create a `test-config.json` file that resembles `example-config.json` and put it in the `test` directory. From the root >directory, run `npm test`.  2. Why doesn't `sendMessage` always work when I'm logged in as a page? > Pages can't start conversations with users directly; this is to prevent pages from spamming users.  3. What do I do when `login` doesn't work? > First check that you can login to Facebook using the website. If login approvals are enabled, you might be logging in incorrectly. For how to handle login approvals, read our docs on [`login`](DOCS.md#login).  4. How can I avoid logging in every time?  Can I log into a previous session? > We support caching everything relevant for you to bypass login. `api.getAppState()` returns an object that you can save and pass into login as `{appState: mySavedAppState}` instead of the credentials object.  If this fails, your session has expired.  5. Do you support sending messages as a page? > Yes, set the pageID option on login (this doesn't work if you set it using api.setOptions, it affects the login process). > ```js > login(credentials, {pageID: \"000000000000000\"}, (err, api) => { \u2026 } > ```  6. I'm getting some crazy weird syntax error like `SyntaxError: Unexpected token [`!!! > Please try to update your version of node.js before submitting an issue of this nature.  We like to use new language features.  7. I don't want all of these logging messages! > You can use `api.setOptions` to silence the logging. You get the `api` object from `login` (see example above). Do > ```js > api.setOptions({ >     logLevel: \"silent\" > }); > ```  <a name=\"projects-using-this-api\"></a> ## Projects using this API:  - [c3c](https://github.com/lequanglam/c3c) - A bot that can be customizable using plugins.

        "description": "we introduce a new framework for running the finite element (FE) packages inside an online Loop together with MATLAB. Contrary to the Hardware-in-the-Loop techniques (HiL), in the proposed Software-in-the-Loop framework (SiL), the FE package represents a simulation platform replicating the real system which can be out of access due to several strategic reasons, e.g., costs and accessibility. Practically, SiL for sophisticated structural design and multi-physical simulations provides a platform for preliminary tests before prototyping and mass production. This feature may reduce the new product\u2019s costs significantly and may add several flexibilities in implementing different instruments with the goal of shortlisting the most cost-effective ones before moving to real-time experiments for the civil and mechanical systems. The proposed SiL interconnection is not limited to ABAQUS as long as the host FE package is capable of executing user-defined commands in FORTRAN language. The focal point of this research is on using the compiled FORTRAN subroutine as a messenger between ABAQUS/CAE kernel and MATLAB Engine. In order to show the generality of the proposed scheme, the limitations of the available SiL schemes in the literature are addressed in this paper. Additionally, all technical details for establishing the connection between FEM and MATLAB are provided for the interested reader. Finally, two numerical sub-problems are defined for offline and online post-processing, i.e., offline optimization and closed-loop system performance analysis in control theory.

In this course, we will introduce from scratch the basic concepts of the quantum circuit model (qubits, gates and measures) and use them to study some of the most important quantum algorithms and protocols, including those that can be implemented with a few qubits (BB84, quantum teleportation, superdense coding...) as well as those that require multi-qubit systems (Deutsch-Jozsa, Grover, Shor..). We will also cover some of the most recent applications of quantum computing in the fields of optimization and simulation (with special emphasis on the use of quantum annealing, the quantum approximate optimization algorithm and the variational quantum eigensolver) and quantum machine learning (for instance, through the use of quantum support vector machines and quantum variational classifiers). We will also give examples of how these techniques can be used in chemistry simulations and high energy physics problems.  The focus of the course will be on the practical aspects of quantum computing and on the implementation of algorithms in quantum simulators and actual quantum computers (as the ones available on the IBM Quantum Experience and D-Wave Leap). No previous knowledge of quantum physics is required and, from the mathematical point of view, only a good command of basic linear algebra is assumed. Some familiarity with the python programming language would be helpful, but is not required either. ",

        "description": "iSpeech's open source javascript SDK for speech recognition (ASR) API, enables you to easily create Web applications using iSpeech freeform, command or custom statistical language models. The speech recognition API powering this speech recognition SDK supports nearly 30 languages and accents. The acoustic models are based on huge amounts of low and high quality hand labeled audio data (millions of utterances).  iSpeech is a viable alternative to Google ASR (Web Speech API), which only includes Voice Search and Freeform Models, or others that do not offer a Javascript SDK to our knowledge.  -Currently this SDK has been tested and works on Chrome and Firefox, but not Internet Explorer (IE) or Safari - (has not been tested on Opera browser)  *you may need to contact iSpeech to create custom models **if you do not have an iSpeech account and need to test, you may request credits *** iOS, Android, Java, .NET, Python and other SDKs are also available",
